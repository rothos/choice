## Introduction

### Statement of Intent

This book contains a distillation and summary of the most useful and practical ideas of the Immanent Metaphysics. These ideas are presented with the intent of enabling the reader to lead a more meaningful, healthy life. This book represents a personal search for those concepts believed to be of maximum value and usefulness in making effective choices. The intent is to provide the philosophical foundations necessary for people in western culture to enhance the quality of all life.

Rather than attempt to be a final work on the philosophy of choice, the aim of this book is to provide potent seed ideas and concepts for further reflection and development. The ideas presented herein are starting points for deeper consideration, meditation, and devolution. As a summary, this book contains only as much text as is needed to gracefully outline those notions which are of maximum significance and importance in the living of a high quality life. Emphasis on clarity and essence is inherent in this philosophy.

### The Format of Presentation

In order to be of the greatest possible value, this book has been formatted as a series of related 'aphorisms'. An aphorism is a short and precise statement of an essential principle. Although the writing of aphorisms is not the usual prose form in philosophical literature, it has the significant advantage of ensuring clear access to the prime ideas and concepts of this philosophy. Individual aphorisms allow maximum emphasis on essentials while using a minimum of text.

As such, this book contains no exhaustive (and exhausting) explanations, metaphors or statements of implication. While such content might date understanding *in the short-term,* it can often result in long-term misunderstanding. Requiring the reader to wade through many histories, metaphors, an examples can obscure those essential concepts intended for immediate practical application.

Emphasis on a precise meaning is not to be construed as an attempt to logically prove the formal correctness of any of the assertions herein[[It is expected that most readers would find little significance in speculating whether this book is momentarily satisfies the technical demands of a handful of abstract theorists. However, there is a formal basis and foundation for all of the content in this book. Readers who are interested in the deeper metaphysical dynamics underlying all of this material should contact the author for more information.]]. This work is intended to provide maximum benefit to those who would actually <u>apply</u> these ideas. It is expected that the readers of this book will be interested in satisfying the immediate concerns of their daily lives.

This summary of seed ideas and concepts is not an attempt to "convince" anyone of anything. Readers looking to be convinced that some philosophical proposition is 'absolutely true' must do their own research to determine, prove, and validate their own notions of truth.

The process of learning and finding truth is more effective when one searches for what is true, rather than that which is false. It is of little use to "be convinced" of something, or to spend all of one's time trying to disprove or contradict some assertion. Such rejection is usually based on a misunderstanding, and thus fails to accomplish anything more than confusion. it is far more effective to consider the insight offered by each assertion in the manner in which that insight may be applied. It is hoped that the reader will recognize and eventually trust that there is a reason for every word of statement, every particularity of phrasing in these aphorisms.

### A Reader's Covenant

Beyond a certain natural point, a concept cannot be further simplified without damaging its essence. Most of the content herein has already been distilled to the maximum extent possible. Each word of each statement has been carefully considered and selected for maximum correctness and utility of meaning. The omission of a single word via misquoting, or even a slight change of ordering, can subtly damage and distort the intended meaning. Therefore, the author asks that the reader not attempt to simplify this material for presentation to others.

Distortions of significance (a loss of clarity when attempting to oversimplify an idea) can occur in ways that remain unnoticed, even though they eventually cause much misunderstanding, and if unchecked, mis-application. Therefore, the tendency (and the common desire) to simplify these concepts must be avoided. To realize the best possible long-term benefit of these ideas in our culture please <u>keep the aphorisms intact</u>.

### How to Read this Book

The aphorisms in this manuscript refer to one another and are mutually interdependent. Some aspects of the meaning of each aphorism will only become clear when reading other areas of the text. As such, the reader is encouraged to always continue forward and develop comparisons, rather than to become 'stuck' at any particular point trying to understand one individual statement. The reader should ***<u>not</u>*** expect to immediately comprehend all aspects of the various meanings and applications of each statement made. Reading through the entire manuscript more than once is necessary for complete understanding.

Although the aphorisms have been sequenced in such a manner as to encourage a gradual building of understanding and concept, there is no requirement that they be read in any specific order. The reader is encouraged to occasionally skip around and read those sections of the book that seem 'more interesting' in the moment.

Although you may skip sections to follow your interest, those sections that are chosen should be read very slowly, with total feeling and thoughtfulness. Do not try to 'skim' or read quickly through any part of this text. Approach each statement with full attention, when you are at peace of mind. Consider the complete and full meaning of each statement from several viewpoints before proceeding to the next.

By design, aphorisms implicitly contain several meanings and concepts in addition to those ideas more overtly stated. In most cases, individual assertions can be interpreted in more than one manner. Many of the statements presented here in have carefully-considered, multi-layered meanings. Wherever possible, each interpretation and connotation has been considered (and assured) to be metaphysically valid in many contexts.

Each individual aphorism is intended to be a basis for deep reflective consideration. Such meditation will reveal insights into concepts and aspects which are merely implied. It is better to read a little bit at a time, on some consistent interval, than to attempt to read many pages at one sitting. It is also helpful to meditate for a short interval both before and after reading any portion of this book.

In order to gain more value from the content, the reader is encouraged to consider each passage on several occasions, at varying times of the day and season. In re-reading, points which seemed confusing at first may become easier to understand. Some connections between ideas, reflections, and continuations will be known only when one has read far enough in the text to encounter alternate ends of the same thought.


## Aphorisms of Life

### The Nature of Self

Consciousness is.  
Consciousness is inseparable from all that is real and all that has being (both in parts and in wholes).

Choice is an intrinsic of consciousness.  
No one and no thing (nothing) can take away the reality and beingness of choice for any self, ever.  
Others may be able to influence what choices are apparently available; however, they cannot influence the fact that <u>self makes choice</u>.

Choice applies and is available to all of being, and all levels and aspects of being, for all time. There is no single level or 'unit' of being at which choice only applies, for all of self is involved in the action of choosing. There is no part or level of self which is without choice.

One's being, the eventity[[The term <b>Eventity</b> refers to the combination of the meanings of an entity (thing) and an event. Each interaction, comparison, and being is an eventity.]] of **self**, is the <u>product</u> of  
the sum of all of the choices that one has made, and  
the sum of all of the choices that one could make.

Self does not own or have choice; rather, self is the evolving context of many choices.  
The self arises our of the many common contexts of choice.  
The nature of choice is more basic, more fundamental, than the nature of self[[Technically, a more correct assertion is that 'choice makes self' or that <u>choice has Self</u>. Self is an intrinsic of choice. The idea that 'self has or makes choice' is inaccurate since choice is not 'owned' or 'had' by the self so much as a singularity of self (the common context of selection) is the outcome of a plurality of choices.]].

Self (consciousness, mind) is neither the purely subjective, nor the purely objective; it is a dynamic of transformation, the boundary and interconnection between the inner subjective and the outer objective.

{{footnotes}}

### True Ownership

**Law of True Ownership:** "None can take from you that which you truly own".  
If someone or something can take some thing, some property, or some quality away, even in principle, then it was never truly owned; it is not a part of one's unique Self[[Examples: Experience, choice, time, and validity are Truly Owned.]].

Those things which are not Truly Owned are not owned at all.  
There can be no ownership of that which is external to oneself.

True ownership is not control. True ownership is not commercial.  
One cannot take true ownership, acquire it, give it away, or trade it for something else.

A **Right** refers to the potential to exercise any choice which is a direct enactment of the law of true ownership.

A **Privilege** refers to a/the potential to exercise a choice which requires the accommodation of another and which has been willingly granted by that other.

True ownership is a statement of right. It cannot be legislated.  
Only privileges can be legislated and traded commercially.

Self is always sovereign. The nature of the being of self is not and cannot ever be conditioned or constrained by anything or anyone.

No amount of external acceptance or validation will ever contribute to any degree of self-acceptance. To feel peace, one must accept oneself totally, fully, and unconditionally. This is the essence and the initiation of health, strength, integrity, and spirituality.

{{footnotes}}

### Absolute Inner Security

Security is defined in terms of interaction. It is found in a potentiality to act, regardless of what could happen or has happened. To know true security is to realize the stability and sacredness of one's innermost spiritual nature. True security is intrinsic to self; it cannot be found in any world; it cannot be taken away. Personal security is absolute and truly owned.

Real security (the feeling that one will remain whole, strong, healthy, integral) is something that can only originate from inside the self. It cannot be provided by any other person or organization. External security is ***<u>always</u>*** illusionary; it has no value.

Inner personal security is not the same as protection. To attain absolute protection is to require absolute isolation; the loss of all connection. Absolute isolation can never be obtained, even in principle. Absolute protection requires the absence of all love and life, the loss of all value and significance. Real security, safety, integrity, strength, and health are found only in the Truth of one's ever-continuing ability to choose.

The feeling of security and strength is found in one's awareness of their freedom of choice. In that one cannot not choose, and in that the capability to choose cannot be taken away (it also is Truly Owned), one may always remain secure in choice. The greatest security is in the potential to act, rather than in the prevention of possible acts and events. In this is found the basis of all Faith.

Creation is safe. Choice is safe. All selves are ultimately safe in all worlds.

There is no single domain, world, or universe. No single domain is more fundamental than any other.

All worlds contain some degree of selfness. All selves will always have some positive (non-zero) degree of effective choice in that world. All effective choice will have causal consequences and implement real changes.

The core of self does not belong to any single domain; it is always a part of the process of many domains.  
The self is an axis upon which many worlds turn.

One cannot become entrapped in a domain of one's own imagination. It is always possible to transition to another world. The potentiality to transition to another world is Truly Owned.

No physical boundaries can protect one from the innermost nature of spirit. One does not have to protect oneself from divinity (spirit). There can be no Fear of God(dess(es)).


## Aphorisms of Will

### Aspects of Choice

The essence of choice is resolved into exactly three necessary and sufficient concepts: potentiality, selection, and consequence. Without all of these, there is no choice (an impossible condition).

For choice to be choice, it must have consequences[[When "not choosing" has real consequences and effects, it too must necessarily be considered a choice.]]. A choice that has no effects, or whose effects can be completely undone, is not actually a choice at all; it is inherently an illusion.

*All that is without choice, change, and consequence (causality) is illusion.*  
Only that which is at once choice, change, and causality is **real**.

The strength of feeling that one has choice is the multiplicative product of:
1. the degree to which one perceives the range of options from which they can choose.
2. the degree that each option has actuality/consequence.
3. the degree that the selection of such option is perceived to be unconstrained.

Choice, as free will and self-determination, is realized in the feeling of choosing without external influence, without reason, without any logical compulsion. In part, all choices are based on a feeling of desire deep within the self. There will always be an aspect of personal choice which is not dictated by anything external to oneself.

The focus and strength of choice is at a maximum where attention is at maximum. The nature, range, and possible effects of choice are defined by the scale, position, and orientation of attention. A change in attention necessarily implies a change in the apparent choices available to self.

One can only make choices in the present. One cannot choose in the past or in the future. In that the overwhelming majority of one's being is here and now, so also are one's choices most effective here and now. Focus in the present concentrates the effectiveness of choice.

{{footnotes}}

### Limitation and Freedom

One cannot have freedom; one can only give freedom.  
One does not own love or freedom; one may only participate in its flow and unboundedness.

To be free is to be aware of potentiality and choice. Limitation is the realization of actuality and consequence.

Limitation and freedom always occur together; they are inseparable. Freedom has an intrinsic, inherent, and irreducible aspect which is limitation. Limitation has an aspect which is freedom. Never does a freedom occur without a limitation, and never does a limitation occur without a freedom.

Limitation is as necessary as freedom. Beingness requires focus[[Consider, for example, the action of discipline. Accepting a practice of discipline (a limitation) eventually results in a freedom to achieve optimal self-expression. There can be no limitation where there is no freedom, and there can be no freedom where there is no limitation. In being, the realization of either of the concepts of freedom and limitation implies the realization of the other.]]. Diversity, separateness, limitation, the unknown, and forgetfulness are all to be valued as much as singularity, oneness, freedom, limitlessness, and knowing.

All choice involves both freedom and limitation.

There is nothing which is absolutely free and there is nothing which is absolutely limited and fixed. The action of creation is a realization of freedom, yet all acts of creation inherently involve limitation[[Action is composed of many changes. Creation is composed of many choices, and always involves an element of freedom. Limitation always involves an element of causality. In the same way that limitation and freedom are inseparable, choice, change, and causality are also inseparable. They always occur together.]].

There is no "transcendence" of limitation. One can work with limitations by adding to them: expanding freedoms by adding other levels, dimensions, and qualities.

The limitations, patterns, and forms created or defined *<u>by</u>* the self are not limitations, patterns or forms *<u>of</u>* the self. Self has being in many other worlds than the one where these patterns, limitations, and forms are manifested, structured, and defined.

{{footnotes}}

### The Cooperative Choice

All of choice is creative. Personal choice is the participation of self in the universal aspect of creation.

All choice is cooperative. Choice can only be given, never taken.  
Both creation and choice are necessarily and fundamentally cooperative.

No other person's choices, nor any consensus belief system, can compel, force, or constrain anyone to choose or believe anything in particular.

In the same manner that everything participates in change and causality, everything also has potentiality, possibility, and choice. One cannot choose in such a way that another cannot have choice. One cannot even choose not to have choice; to voluntarily 'not choose' is also a choice. Choice is Truly Owned.

Choice is not conserved, finite, or limited; the self cannot "run out of choice(s)".  
Creativity is not conserved; there is always more creativity and more choices.  
Every choice creates and enables other choices. Choice always begets choice.

Every choice is unique unto itself and can only be made once.

Choice cannot take away from the beingness of choice itself.  
Choice in the past can never reduce the amount or degree of choice in the present[[Choice can set the context of other choices. While this shift in context could be viewed as a partial limitation and constraint on other choices, it is a choice to view it in this manner — a hidden choice that must also be considered as contributing to the total 'volume' of choice available to self in the present.]].

Choice cannot absolutely fix or limit other choices. Choice can only enable other choices.

Ultimately, there is never any control over that which is internal to self.  
Desire has no reason and cannot be permanently constrained.  
There is no control over creativity. Creation itself is not controllable or constrainable.

No form of control is absolute; all process has some aspect of a cooperative nature. There is no control, there is only influence. It is fundamentally impossible to completely and/or absolutely control or constrain anything, in any domain, under any circumstances, ever.

There are always other possibilities, probabilities, and potentialities. Any potentiality can be made actual.

There cannot not continue to be creation and evolution in all worlds and in all domains. Creation is not an event. Creation is an aspect of events, rather than their source.

Nothing within a world can prevent the creation of new events, the creation of a new world. One relation cannot ultimately limit the beingness of other relations. Interaction cannot prevent interaction; it can only beget it.

All perception involves expression and all expression involves perception. In all the worlds in which one perceives and has feeling, there cannot not be a possibility of expression, a symbol and form of the self; a body projected as substance within that world. This symbol of mediation is the focus through which one expresses within that world. Where one perceives and has feeling, one cannot be fully silent (secret).

Creativity does not happen somewhere or to someone; rather it is inherently everywhere and within everyone. One does not need to "tap into" something external to oneself to create, to heal, to know something or to have imagination. In the very process of living, each of these qualities will take its own form.

Therefore, have faith in innate creativity and self-expression.  
Where creativity is needed, it is always inherently available.

{{footnotes}}

### Choice Coordination

Self is not a thing, and it is not single, nor is it simple. Self (mind) cannot be defined or accumulated by any assembly of parts or theories. There is no 'unit' of self. A self is the product and integral synthesis of many aspects in natural communication.

All worlds are open and unbounded at the scale of the absolute microscopic, even while they must appear to be closed and bounded at the scale of the absolute macroscopic. All that enters into a world appears first at the microscopic limit[[For example, the entrance of any new life (self) into a world always occurs through a single choice in multiple places (in the coincidence of at least two people). All birth begins at the smallest scale of existence.]]. All creativity begins as a single event of interaction and co-incidence in the smallest scales, everywhere at once. All expression is an assembly of microscopic moments of intention.

The freedom of self to realize potential is directly related to the internal coherency, consistency, and continuity of that self. Where self is internally divided, there is much less freedom of choice.

The strength of a potentiality, or creative manifestation, is realized in the organization and coherency of many microscopic eventualities. The strength (energy) of a choice is proportional to the number of sub-choices in alignment necessary to bring about the actuality of consequence. Each alignment is itself a choice; a choice within a choice.

Change is not additive. Large, unbounded collections of 'insignificant small changes' can create overall effects far out of proportion to the apparent causes[[This remains true, even though any small or bounded collection of microscopic eventualities will necessarily appear to have very little potentiality.]]. The degree to which emergent, novel, and creative aspects are apparent is proportional to the degree to which there is a difference in scale between the mesoscopic[[<b>Mesoscopic</b>: middle scales; those ordinary ranges of size comparable to a human being.]] scale (known) and microscopic (unknown).

Creation and creativity inherently involve the microscopic and the momentary potentiality. Small, incremental changes occurring everywhere at once are more conducive to creative expression than suddenly-realized 'grand sweeping events'.

The realization of choices at more encompassing levels of being is in the degree of the *coordination* of the choices which are distributed across the many selves of the encompassed levels of being[[For example, the realization of the choice to go to college is realized in a coordination (organization) of many smaller day-to-day choices to go to class, do one's homework, study, etc.]].

The degree of individual freedom in a society increases dramatically in proportion to the degree of cooperation among individuals. A society or culture is strong to the degree that *everyone* is allowed to live creatively and live together.

A maximum of both acceptance and expression, unity and diversity, is necessary for a nation (society, tradition, religion, culture) to be strong. Diversity must be accepted and unity must be expressed. To have an expression of unity there must be an acceptance of diversity. To have an acceptance of diversity there must be an expression of unity. The strength of a nation is known as much through its flexibility and tolerance as through its commitments and follow-through.

## Aphorisms of Love

### The Nature of Love

Love is an experience, an expression, and an understanding. It is the potentiality (essential quality) of all being. Where love is an experience it is a recognition, a knowing, and a realization of one's innermost feelings, dreams and desires. Love is potentiality, that pool of energy from which all desire, dreaming, and action is drawn. Where love is an expression it is the basis and the foundation of all emotion and desire (feeling).

Where love is an understanding, *<u>**love** is that which enables choice</u>*. The quintessential meaning of Love refers to the quality of enabling and nurturing choice, joy, connectedness, and freedom. Love, in that it enables all life, significance, and choice, does not define or precondition being.

Love IS, and cannot not be. Love is unbound and formless. Love cannot be constrained, modified or conditioned by anything which exists. Love is always free, infinite, and giving of freedom.

Nothing which is in existence can prevent love from being loving. Nothing which has the nature of actuality can prevent the action of that which has the nature of potentiality, of creation.

As an energy, love is an emotion rather than a feeling. Energy, as a potentiality, is movement, and is, therefore, to be considered in terms of its intensity and direction rather than in terms of its quality[[<p>The experience of "feeling love" (as a quality) is a reflection of one's desire and in this way is a recognition of potentiality. To consider the 'feeling of love' (rather than the potentiality of love) is to consider a <i>combination</i> of the energy of desire with a significant and personally meaningful quality. It is the added energy of desire and potentiality that encourages one to regard some feelings <u>as love</u> rather than as a feeling of something else.</p><p>The perfectly clear channel of unconditional acceptance (perfect love, which has no quality of feeling in itself) will be considered to have a subtle quality of feeling in direct proportion to the degree that some qualities, feelings, and experiences are regarded as easier to accept and integrate than others. It is in this way that the feeling of love is realized and known to the finite self as a feeling rather than as an unqualified perfection of potentiality. As one's spirituality expands and evolves, one's capacity to realize unconditional love also increases. Love is pure, and without particularity of feeling in proportion to the degree of one's spirituality.</p>]].

Love is the most basic and fundamental emotion. Potentiality, desire, and energy are all intrinsic to all actuality, life, and being. Love is the energy and potentiality from which all other emotion, desire, want, and need, is drawn. All emotions have their root and ultimate basis in love.

Ultimately, the principle of love is unconditional (perfect). The dynamic of love (as "love of doing") is in no way dependent on any specific or particular form, detail, or quality. Love in being (as in "the being of love") is the principle of unconditional acceptance (also perfect).

Love has no opposite[[It is a misconception to think that 'hate' is the opposite of love; hate is only a distorted expression of love. hate has the strong intention and expectation of changing someone or something external to self in a manner which is either unconscious or covertly manipulative. Hate is a characterization of anger, and is thus secretly driven by love. The absence of love is not hate, but apathy.]]. Love is always the deepest and strongest emotion; stronger than fear, anger, or depression.

Love is always and forever given and received in a unique manner, with unique qualities. One cannot expect to receive love and nurturance in the same manner in which it is given.

Love has only the intention of giving. It is never about exchange or expectation. Love has no price; it cannot be bartered or exchanged for anything in the marketplace. Love can only arise as a natural dynamic of the potentiality, creativity, and evolution of being.

Love cannot be forced. It can never be conditioned or earned. Only respect can be earned and conditioned (to compel to be given).

Do something "good" that very few others can do and you <u>will</u> earn respect (an actuality to an actuality).  
Do not do something "bad" that nearly everyone one does, and you *might* be loved (a potentiality to a potentiality).

Respect is more meaningful when it is a reflection of one's actions (what one has done or is currently doing).  
Love is more meaningful when it is an acknowledgment of one's natural being (what one could potentially be).

One does not "have" love, one may only give it. No amount of the giving of love ever diminishes love or the potentiality of further love.

Love and choice are inherently unreasonable and illogical (non-causal). One can never be expected to give a reasonable or logical basis for one's values, desires, or creative decisions[[To the degree that one is able to give a 'reason' for their love, one is expressing a statement of <u>purpose</u>. Defining a relationship in terms of purpose is to describe a business transaction rather than an intimate and inherently meaningful connection. A statement of purpose is not a statement of value; it has no inherent significance. All life is lost when feeling, desire, and love are regarded as without value or significance.]]. Love is best understood and enacted in life in terms of significance, rather than structure, purpose, reason, or monetary value.

Divinity is best known by both love and gratitude. The action of **Love** is to give potentiality (to the world). The action of **Gratitude** is to receive potentiality (from the world).  One feels gratitude and allows a feeling of thankfulness when one accepts and has acceptance. The action of love and gratitude is the action of spirituality, of connecting oneself with the divine.

Love is an acceptance in giving, receiving, and feeling. The movement of love is a movement of self, a flow of potentiality from oneself to another self, a flow of feeling, thought, and perception.

To know love, one must participate in its unbounded flow.  
Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.

In that love is unconditional, acceptance is also unconditional. The effective realization of either unconditional love or unconditional acceptance necessarily implies the effective realization of the other.

The meaning of the term 'acceptance' is not the same as "to give up one's own choice". Acceptance and choice are distinct concepts. Choice is not acceptance. Acceptance is not choice. Acceptance is ultimately not a choice (eventually, everyone must accept at least something). Acceptance is about perception, the integration of perceptions into self. In contrast, choice is about expression. Both are necessary in one's own life.

### The Nature of Desire

Love in its most abstract and *impersonal* sense is pure potentiality, pure energy without quality or form.  
Self in its most abstract and *personal* sense is pure quality without energy or form.

Desire is the combination and synthesis of the quality of self with the energy of love. Ultimate desire is the synthesis of the unlimited expansiveness of impersonal love and the infinitely detailed nature of one's innermost personal quality.

Desire is at once the basis for all choice, the potentiality to choose, and the selectivity of those choices.

Desires are interrelated. They do not occur in isolation and are interdependent with other desires.

Desires have various degrees of depth. Some desires are formed as an implementation of a deeper desire. The knowledge, resolution, and attainment of deeper desires will often decrease the intensity of many other surface desires.

Surface desires are often conflicted; one's deepest desires are never conflicted.

The meaning of a surface desire is clarified when its foundation in deeper desire is known. When surface desires appear to be in conflict, the knowledge and realization of one's deeper desires will always resolve that conflict.

When desires are confused (i.e., are internally conflicting or are unclear), or when one has conflicting ideas and beliefs, one has effectively become two smaller selves, each of which has significantly less freedom of choice.

One chooses most effectively when choosing as a unified self as a whole being, with attunement and at-one-ment with one's own innermost (deepest) desires.

### The Basal Motivations

**The Basal Motivations of All Life:** There are two ultimate desires inherent in all being:

- The desire to create and be creative (the expression of self-quality).
- The desire to experience and have experiences (the perception of form).

The most basic desire inherent in all consciousness is to maximize the degree (quantity), diversity (quality), and intensity of both the creative experience and the experience of creativity.

The ultimate purpose of evolution is to simultaneously maximize the degree of experience and creativity of all aspects of life, in all aspects of life.

The basal motivations are at the foundation of all desire and all cognition. Together they are the basis for and foundation of all love, life, growth, evolution, transformation, interaction, communication, learning, experimentation, being, and doing.

Creativity is expressive. It has its basis in potentiality.  
Experience is perceptive. It has its basis in actuality.  
Both actuality and potentiality need to be maximized for the full realization of life.  
Quality is as important as quantity. Potentiality is as important as actuality.

To maximize actuality (quantity) is to maximize experience and clear acceptance;  
the integrity of self, world, and symmetry in the relations between self and world.  
To maximize potentiality (quality) is to maximize nurturing choice and expression;  
the creativity of self, world, and continuity in the relations between self and world.

Creativity and experience are at a maximum when the greatest possible degree of the combination of static and dynamic aspects are realized. A maximum intensity of action occurs where elements of dynamic choice and creativity are intimately combined with elements of stable causality and experience.

All natural selection seeks to maximize both potentiality/creativity/evolution and actuality/experience/interaction. Optimal changes are ones which maximize the realization of future choices and the manifestation of past causality.

### Desire, Want, and Need

Love has three aspects: Desire, want, and need.  
These aspects refer to the quality, form, and intensity of love respectively.  
Want, need, and desire are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.  
Each has its place, value, and validity.

The meaning of want, need, and desire are distinguished by where they arise and where they are realized. Considering the self as a conduit of connection between spirit and matter, soul and body:

- **Desires** are feelings that arise within the soul to affect the self.  
  They can only be realized from within the soul (an aspect of spirit).
- **Needs** arise within the self and can only be realized within the self (an aspect of mind).
- **Wants** come from the outer world and arise within the body to affect the self.  
  They can only be realized within or through the body (an aspect of world).

Wants, needs, and desires are abstractions of thoughts, feelings, and emotions respectively.  
They are instructions[['Ab-stract' as "out of form". 'In-struct' as "into form".]] of purpose, value, and meaning respectively.  
A life must realize all three, in proper balance, to be complete.

The realization of a feeling occurs in the same location and depth of self as that from which it arose.  
The satisfaction of a feeling is always a return to the origin of that feeling[[Feelings, thoughts, and emotions are not just aspects of that part of self known as 'mind' but as aspects of <i>all</i> of self. For example, feeling arise in the soul, the self, and the body.]].

### Effective Choice

An **Effective choice** is one that results in the realization and manifestation of desire[[Note: Effectiveness is defined in terms of desire rather than in terms of either want or need.]].

The most effective choices are those which maximally support creativity and experience in the world, in the self, and in the dynamics between them.

An ultimately effective choice is one which realizes (manifests) the ultimate desires of all that is making that choice and all that is affected by that choice.

The ultimate innermost nature of self/soul is good. Ineffective actions and choices result from a lack of clarity between the soul and the mind. To have a lack of clarity is to have a lack of knowing and of understanding; it is an absence of wisdom.

To improve one's knowing and understanding is to increase clarity within the self, the effectiveness of one's choices, and the degree to which one experiences joy/happiness. Those who choose ineffectively can be nurtured and healed by enabling them to increase their degree of knowledge and understanding (i.e., teaching by example).

The most effective choices provide or result in the greatest degree of wholeness and integrity of both self and world (necessary for experience), while at the same time allowing for the greatest freedom to make additional future choices for oneself and others (necessary for creativity).

The degree of effectiveness of one's choices is proportional to the product of the degree to which one's choices and their results, coherently maintain, sustain, enhance, and nurture:

1. the integrity and wholeness (the actuality and actualization) of the world, the self, and the relation between world and self.
2. the potentiality/realization/evolution of creativity and experience in all of life, including one's own life (the degree to which it potentiates other choices).

Perception is effective to the degree that it is dispassionate, without judgment, precondition, or expectation.

Expression is effective to the degree that it is passionate — a reflection of one's dreams and inspiration — and is a clear manifestation of one's highest hopes and aspirations.

## Aphorisms of Mind

### Emotions, Thoughts, and Feelings

Emotions, thoughts, and feelings are distinct[[Western culture has a tendency to confuse emotion and feeling. They are not the same. As a metaphor, to consider a beam of light in terms of its direction and intensity (emotion) is not to consider it in terms of its color (feeling).]], inseparable, and non-interchangeable aspects of mind. Feelings are not emotions. Thoughts are not feelings.

- Each **emotion** refers to a strength, direction, and flow of energy in the mind.  
  Emotion is the intensity and the direction of the flows of expression and experience.
- Each **thought** refers to a form, structure, or pattern of perception or expression.  
  Thoughts refer to an energy of the self which has become fixed in form.  
  Thoughts are the form, pattern, and structure of the flows of mind.
- Each **feeling** refers to a quality of energy, regardless of its direction, form or intensity of the flow in mind.  
  Feelings refer to qualities, timbres, and colors of one's experiences and expressions.

To discuss emotion is to discuss only the intensity and direction of the flow of one's mind.  
To discuss thought is to discuss only the form, pattern, and structure of those flows.  
To discuss feeling is to discuss only the quality, timbre, and color of those flows.

Emotions are experienced in terms of intensity. Thoughts are experienced in terms of form and quantity. Feelings are experienced in terms of color and quality.

Emotions are ultimate, basic and simple, whereas thoughts and feelings are inherently complex.

Emotions are considered in terms of their power and intensity.  
The self which experiences these emotions is considered in terms of strength.

Thoughts are mostly structure and have very little energy (static).  
Emotions are mostly energy (very dynamic) and have little structure.  
Neither thought, pattern, form, nor energy are in themselves quality.

Emotion is the energy that moves the self, moves through the self, or moves from the self.  
Emotions are the potentialities by which changes may be made in the dynamics of self.

Emotion (energy) changes thought, perception, and expression. Desire (feeling) shapes the power of emotion (its direction of expression and intensity) and emotion is the basis by which thought is shaped within the mind. All perception and expression is itself a process of emotion.

One cannot have feelings without thoughts and emotions.  
One cannot have thoughts without also having emotions and feelings.  
One cannot have emotions without also having thoughts and feelings.

One must (cannot not) have feelings. Feelings are. Similarly, one cannot not have emotions and thoughts.

The degree to which the soul evolves is in proportion to the degree to which the self continues to choose to be aware of, is aware of, and consciously experiences feeling.

Emotion influences thinking and feeling; thinking influences feeling and emotion; feeling influences emotion and thinking.

Each thought is a static result, a distillation of a specific aspect of one's perception. Thinking is a process of change in, and transformation of, perception. Thinking intrinsically involves energy. The emotions of one's mind are the flow of changes in thought, perception, and thinking, even as one's thoughts confine and direct the flow of emotion and change[[Emotions are like the flow of a river. The course of a river is at once shaped by its banks (thought shapes emotion) even as the river gradually shifts those banks (over time, the course of a river changes).]].

Thoughts are static; feelings are dynamic. Feelings can only change.  
Feelings are never purely chosen or conditioned.

One's feelings cannot be controlled by anything internal or external to oneself. The feelings that one has are never causal or reasonable or logical; or just the result of only causal, logical, or reasonable processes.

Nothing in the world can force or condition one to feel a certain way or to have a specific feeling with predictable and definite qualities. One's feelings are always personal, Truly Owned by oneself.

Where there is perception, experience, or causality, there is also expression, choice, and change.  
All of life (all beingness at all scales of all domains) must grow, expand, and become more.

{{footnotes}}

### The Dynamics of Emotion

Emotions are "the energy that moves the mind" (as e-motion). They literally power, or give strength to, one's thoughts.

Emotion has a reasonable and orderly pattern, connected to our choices, intentions, and inner nature. Emotion is the energy that moves the mind of self.

There are five basic and primary emotions. These are the foundation from which all other emotions are derived. They are love, fear, anger, frustration, and depression. These five emotions occur in definite patterns and are related to a specific occurrence of thoughts, perceptions, and feelings.

Emotion is a reasonable and natural dynamic of life which ultimately increases consciousness, quality, and significance. Awareness of fear, anger, frustration, or depression is an opportunity to restore the quality of life and maintain health.

Love is the first and most primal emotion. All emotional dynamics begin with love, and always ultimately have love at their root. Love is the pool of potential energy which is at the basis of all spirit.

Love is that which enables choice. Love is undifferentiated potentiality at the subjective core (soul) of all being. It is a spiritual energy which moves in all directions at once.

The innate, innermost nature of self (soul) has the being of unconditional love. In being unconditional love **is**, and is ultimately associated with the soul. The absolute inner nature of self is ultimately 'good', regardless of surface manifestations.

Love becomes fear when there is a perception, though, or belief of the possibility for loss of something or someone that is valued, significant, desired, or loved.

Fear is a flow of energy (from soul and spirit toward mind), which is directed towards the core of the incarnate body to enable the self to act. Fear is felt near the center of self. Fear awakens consciousness and focuses attention in being; it makes one aware of the need for action.

There is no fear that is not fear of loss. The degree of fear is in direct proportion to the degree of significance of the perceived loss. There can be no fear where there is no love. As such, the emotion of fear is never stronger than love; love is always stronger than fear. The intensity of one's fear is an indication of the significance of the love which defines it.

Fear always has at its basis a perception of the potential loss of something valued, important, and meaningful (something or someone loved). Through a recognition of the basis of fear one is returned to the root emotion (love).

Fear becomes anger when there is a perception, thought, or belief that it is the world — rather than the self — which must change; that no amount of change or action within oneself can prevent the possibility of loss.

Anger (when unconscious, reacting) and passion (where conscious, acting in a healthy and integrated manner) are flows of energy direction from the mind into the external world to enable (or catalyze) the world to act and change. Both passion and anger potentiate change and action on the part of that which is other than self. It is an attempt by the self to enable someone or something else to act, choose, and change on the behalf of self.

All anger finds its strength and basis in fear. All passion finds its strength and basis in love. Where there is no desire, there can be no passion.

An angry person has consciously forgotten what they really care about and who or what they truly love. A passionate person remembers what the angry person has forgotten[[<p>A person who is only conscious of their anger tends to make very poor choices. They are ineffective at changing a situation so that it accurately supports that underlying desire (enabling a return to love). They are reacting rather than acting or responding. The expression of love is distorted in anger.</p><p>Passionate expression, in contrast, tends to be more conscious and pure, supporting and enabling all concerned to realize significance and return to love. Passion is effective to the extent that it realizes love with clarity and intensity (without distortion).</p>]].

Anger always has, at its basis, fear. Anger is a desire to change the outside world. To truly know what one wishes to change and why, is to recognize the fear at the root of anger.

Anger becomes frustration when there is a perception, thought, or belief that change in the world is not actually occurring; that no amount of personal action will effect change in the world, and that the possibility of loss will become an actuality of loss.

Frustration is the experience of a blockage in personal energy directed outward. It occurs when passion (or anger) is perceived to be ineffective, resisted, or confined. Frustration is a reflection of an initial failure to satisfy underlying concerns, desires, loves, needs, or wants. Frustration is blocked anger or passion. It is a (believed to be) temporary disconnection in the flow between self and world.

Frustration always has, at its basis, blocked energy. It manifests in the perception that there is something external to self which acts in opposition to one's desire.

Frustration becomes depression when there is a perception, thought, or belief that no change is significant; that a loss has actually occurred and that it is permanent; that changes in self or world would make no difference.

Depression is characterized by the belief that no amount of action will make any difference. Where there is no choice, spirit departs from the body, and the mind becomes empty (without thinking) and insensitive (without feeling). Depression is a blockage in the flow of energy (the connection) between soul and self. Depression is an isolation and aloneness of self, a being cut off from both inner spirit (personal dreams and innate significance) and the outer world (other people).

Depression always has, at its basis, a feeling of powerlessness. It manifests as a lack of energy (apathy) to make changes which are important, valued, and meaningful.

The greater the degree of love, significance, and value, and the clearer and more sudden the perception (belief) of possible loss, the stronger and more intense the resulting emotions of fear, anger, and depression.

The more the cause of a potential loss is perceived to be external, the more rapid the transition from love to fear and from fear to anger. The intensity of fear and anger is proportional to the strength of the source of emotion of love.

The degree, depth, and duration of frustration and depression is proportional to the intensity and strength of the original love and the degree of perceived ineffectiveness of any possibility of change.

An enlightened person has learned to use an awareness of their emotions as an indication and reminder of what is truly loved, valued, and desired. In this way, strong emotions (rather than being a hindrance) are effective tools of change and consciousness. Emotions provide a clear path to knowing what one loves; a true knowledge of self.

### Principles of Change

With respect to one's subjective time in any domain (world), the <u>rate of change</u> is proportional to the degree that one's focus of attention is internal, and is inversely proportional to the degree that one's focus of attention is external.

Within the self, change occurs only when there is attention and commitment.  
Within the world, change occurs only when there is an <u>absence</u> of attention and commitment.

*Within the self,* a focus of attention (awareness of choice) begets change, at the location of that focus. The more that one focuses attention on that which is internal, the more quickly change will be realized. Those things which are observed as being most within, or which are the most microscopic, will have the greatest rates of change relative to one's natural subjective sense of time.

*Within the world,* a focus of attention (awareness of causality) halts change, at the location of that focus. The more that one focuses attention on that which is external, the more slowly change will be realized. Those things which are observed as being the most without, or which are the most macroscopic, will have the slowest rates of change relative to one's natural subjective sense of time.

A focus of attention on quality (feelings) increases dynamicism (change; decreases permanence).  
A focus of attention on quantity (thought, form) increases staticism (decreases change).

The degree to which it seems that there are many subjective moments for each objective moment (i.e., the degree that one 'lives life fully') is proportional to the degree to which the dynamics of one's life involves many full transitions of context, state, and orientation. The strength of this effect increases in proportion to the degree that each transition involves many qualities, feelings, and levels of depth within the self and that these transitions are varied, significant, and novel (unique).

The degree to which one's subjective experience of time seems to be exceeded by that of the objective experience of the world (that 'time passes quickly') is proportional to the degree that there is an absence of change, novelty, quality, and richness in the dynamics of one's life. This will occur when one experiences life using only one level of consciousness, without any changes in context, state or orientation; and when one interacts with the world only in terms of purpose, structure, form, rather than in terms of significance, sacredness, and feeling.

Awareness is a coordination of choice; it inherently involves potentiality and energy. Awareness of a feeling or thought changes it. Nothing which is internal to oneself — and which remains in one's focused attention – will remain unchanged. The maximum degree of choice and change is possible at the location of the focus of attention.

To experience a change in feeling, one must fully experience feeling. The degree that one's feelings change is directly proportional to the degree that one experiences them with clarity. Feelings change with our awareness and attention. Feelings that are given no attention (are suppressed or held back from one's experience of the present moment) do not change. They will remain constant until experienced fully at the level of self from which they arise.

By changing many thoughts, one changes a single quality of feeling.  
By changing many feelings, one changes each emotion.  
By changing many emotions, one changes a single thought.

### Intelligence

**Thinking** is the changing of relations in perception. Thinking is the process of change in the organization of an individual's perception. A **Thought** is a single, specific change in the organization of perception. An **idea** is the relationship between sets of perceptions. A **concept** is a relationship between multiple ideas.

The apparent degree of **intelligence** is in proportion to the rate of change of relations in perception (insight). Changes in relations of perception are to be understood in terms of <u>span</u> and <u>depth</u>.

- **Span** refers to the number of perceptions and the degree of the dissimilarity of the perceptions which are changed in any given domain of perception (thinking/existence).
- **Depth** refers to the number and dissimilarity (in terms of degrees of abstraction) of the domains in which those changes of perception occur.

The quality of intelligence is considered in terms of the depth, clarity, and rapidity of those changes. The quantity of intelligence is proportional to the degree that one's perceptions and thoughts are transformed into other perceptions and thought, and is inversely proportional to the time required to implement those transformations. The greater the degree of the change in perception, the greater the number of ways in which that change occurs, and the more rapidly the change occurs, the greater the degree of intelligence.

Clarity is the basis of discipline in thinking. In the practice of spirituality, philosophy, and art, <u>clarity</u>, no simplicity, is the more essential value. To speak and write with elegance and grace is not to be demonstrably simple, as much as it is to be profoundly clear.

The concepts of simplicity and clarity are distinct, even though they may often appear in the same context.

To be clear is to allow creation. The ability to realize creation and creativity increases with one's clarity and transparency; a form of silence, emptiness, and potentiality.

Creativity decreases when there is an emphasis on simplicity rather than on essence. Events of greater degrees of synthesis and complexity have stronger aspects of creation/creativity. Evolution only happens where there is complexity and where that complexity increases.

Clarity is necessary to maintain an open mind and to perceive deep truths. An effective person will frequently examine implicit, hidden assumptions and expectations. When one releases expectations, it often becomes possible to gain new and valuable insights.

To be effective, proceed with an emphasis on clarity of essence. Do not submit to the desire or drive for simplicity of appearance.

Effectiveness in thinking is proportional to the degree that the desire and value for diversity, dynamicism, complexity, clarity, and asymmetry, is equal to the desire for simplicity, symmetry, and permanence.

Communication is reality. The synthesis of multiple perspectives is greater than their sum. The self which is knowledgeable about many worlds has greater wisdom in each of them.

Just as the synthesis of multiple languages grants the speaker a deeper knowing (including a knowing of the essential nature of language), so also does the use of multiple levels, channels, and interchanges of interaction with a reality grant a deeper knowing (including a knowing of the essence of reality). The depth of such knowing obtained is greater than the sum of its components.

To be able to think within and about a multiplicity of different languages is important. The choice of the language (assumptions, subjective context) used in one's consideration has a profound effect on the trend and effectiveness of one's thinking.

### Learning and Memory

**Learning** is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of a perception.  
**Evolution** is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of life.

To learn is to organize attention. To be wise is to organize intention.  
To have learning (to have knowing) is to have organized attention (a process of being/perception).  
Understanding is the result of organized expression.

The process of learning is a movement, a transition of the boundary of self, of attention and awareness expanding outward. Learning is a transition form 'working with' to 'working through'.

- One **works with** something that one regards as external to oneself.
- One **works through** something that one regards as an extension of one's own being, as a part of oneself.

The whole of one's learning affects each choice, each perception. A collection of choices (perceptions) defines one's attention (awareness). To learn something one must organize one's attention, which in itself requires a consistent pattern of choices. To make a choice is to apply the whole of one's learning.

Within any one particular orientation of consciousness, the accuracy of memory is improved by the use of discrete correspondences and patterns of relationship (forms). Qualities (feelings) are retained in memory by first converting (binding) them to discrete patterns and forms.

Clarity of one's memory is diminished by rapid changes in one's state of consciousness in proportion to their rapidity and suddenness. Clarity of memory is also diminished by significant transitions from feeling-oriented consciousness to form-oriented consciousness, or vice versa.

Continuity of memory (the sequence of subjective experience) depends on a continuity of consciousness (the maintaining of a similar state of mind). When one forgets (a form of discontinuity), it is often a signal that the context of mind, the state of one's consciousness, has changed.

The degree that one retains memory across the transition of a state of consciousness is inversely proportional to the suddenness of that transition. For the maximum transfer of information with minimum distortion from one state of consciousness to another, one language or world to another, one self to another, a proportional match must be made between the frequency and density of each state, each language[[This may often be facilitated by the deliberate introduction of several intermediate stages (languages, states of consciousness, etc). Calibrate each added state to closely match the preceding and succeeding ones.]].

The degree of clarity associated with a memory (perception) is directly proportional to the degree of similarity of feeling in one's subjective context (perceiver) and to the degree of proximity of form in the objective content (perceived).

The process of learning, as well as the process of evolution, life, and conversation, is as dependent on forgetting as it is on remembering. One has to 'remember' and build upon past memories and learning. Yet, one must also 'forget' the myriad details and 'fine choices' required for each action to become free and make use of the learning gained.

The limitation of habitual action at one level of being is a freedom of unconstrained action in other levels of being. Habituation and unconsciousness are as important and valued to self as are the immediacy of awareness and consciousness. In habituation, the choices that are made become automatic, and *stay* made, so that one does not have to 're-choose' the same details over and over again[[This choice to focus awareness is no different than the choice that the mind makes to omit a distracting 'complete and thorough awareness of every minute detail required of one's body to walk across the room'. When one learns to walk, or to ride a bike, the process of this action becomes automatic for precisely the same reasons. It enables one to be able to focus on other things, like the scenery that one is walking through. States of consciousness, one's beingness within a world, become defined and fixed by choices of the same nature.]].

{{footnotes}}

### Habits of Mind

A **belief** refers to a structure of mind that:

1. acts as a filter (transformation operator) of one's perceptions and knowing.
2. acts as a predisposition (instruction operator) in one's understanding and expression.

The notion of 'a belief' is similar to that of a presumption; both have a ubiquitous, unconscious nature. A belief is an unconscious or subconscious choice. Beliefs are similar to (and are usually encoded as) thoughts, ideas, and concepts. When beliefs are fixed and unchanging (unchangeable, non-dynamic), they may have characteristics and effects similar to those of prejudice.

Beliefs (structures of mind) exist and have interdependencies at varying levels of depth. Some beliefs reside at deeper contextual levels, providing the foundations upon which other beliefs are conceived and used.

All structures of mind are interdependent, with varying degrees of asymmetry. The deeper structures of soul are more subjectively stable and persistent than those nearer the mind, which are more transient.

The depth of a belief is proportional to the number of situations in which that belief applies; the more the belief is a part of the subjective context. The deepest beliefs are those which form the ubiquitous assumptions and taken for granted truths which apply in nearly all situations. They are the foundations upon which many other beliefs are built.

## Aphorisms of Health

### Joy and Pain

*First parallel aspect:*  
One has an experience of **joy** when one perceives and increase in one's potentialities.  
Events and choices which increase apparent freedom, are expansive, and decrease feelings of limitation.  
These events will tend to result in experiences and feelings of joy.

*Second parallel aspect:*  
One has an experience of **pain** when one perceives a decrease in one's potentialities.  
Events and choices which decrease apparent freedoms, are constrictive, and increase feelings of limitation.  
These events will tend to result in experiences and feelings of pain.

Joy and Pain are both real.

Pain is typically literal, factual, and objective, and is found by going into the deep world (reality).  
Joy is typically symbolic, mythical, and subjective, and is found by going into the deep Self.  
To shift from the mythical to the factual is to decrease potential and experience pain.  
To shift from the factual to the mythical is to increase potential and express joy.

Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow. These events decrease apparent potentiality. All pain is a reflection (a realization) of discontinuity. Pain occurs when there is a break, breach, or sudden change.

Joy corresponds to the potentiality of events of connection, continuity, and union.  
These are events which increase the feeling of potentiality.

**Humor:** the ability to create and convey an immediate, vivid, and unexpected expansive shift in the interpretation and significance.[[The connection between joy and potentiality is experienced in all forms of humor. The essence of telling a good joke is the unexpected shift to an alternate interpretation, one which creates an expanded view of a situation. The shift to an alternate view, the recognition or creation of an absurdity, etc., are all expansive in comparison to one's initial understandings and expectations; they are implicitly perceived as an increase in potentiality; that there is more than one way—a choice—in how a situation may be perceived. The effectiveness of humor is in proportion to the novelty, immediacy, and vividness of the moment of expanded realization. As such, an experience of humor is recognized as being a momentary experience of joy; a moment expressed in laughter. As such, 'to have a sense of humor' is correctly recognized as a spiritual quality; an ability to accept more expansive interpretations of each situation.]]

Joy and pain are not opposites; they are complementary aspects of a deeper whole. They have the same relationship to each other that potentiality has with actuality. They are both found in proportion to the intensity of the self-to-world interaction. Where the degree of the intensity of the interaction between self and world changes, there will be (cannot not be) either joy or pain or both.

An experience of joy does <u>not</u> result in or require an experience of pain. Nor does it make one any more or less likely to experience pain. Nor does the actuality of an experience of pain make the potentiality of an experience of joy any more likely. It is never "necessary for balance" to have equal degrees of experience of joy and pain. One does not need to experience pain to experience joy. Even a large amount of pain will not necessarily result in or imply that one will have even a very small amount of joy. The one does <u>not</u> necessitate the other. There is no glory in suffering!

One cannot increase or decrease the potentiality of either joy or pain without also increasing or decreasing the potentiality of the other.

To increase the potentiality of joy, one must increase the actuality of the intensity of interaction. Without the vivid connectedness of interaction, there can be no joy.

Where communication, connection, continuity and communion are fundamentally cooperative processes, and cannot be forced, only strengthened, so also one cannot force, guarantee, or ensure an experience of joy. One's ability to experience joy is proportional to the strength of one's willingness to remain present in the potentialities of the unknown.

One <u>cannot guarantee</u> that joy, happiness, or love will follow as the result of any process, conditioning, practice, or method. No religion, tradition, technology or practice can ever specifically create, force or guarantee that one will experience joy, bliss, satisfaction or happiness, or that one will not ever experience pain, suffering, or loss. The qualities of joyful experience can only be nurtured, not ensured.

To allow and nurture joyfulness will make joy a more likely experience in life. Spirituality (acceptance) and the enactment of love (nurturance) enable and increase the potentiality that one will experience joy.

*First parallel aspect:* Mental and physical processes work best as the result of constrictive choices; choices that have the effect of limiting potentiality. Specific mental and physical states (a context of experience) can be attained as the result of a goal-driven activity. They can be achieved with practice and effort.

*Second parallel aspect:* Emotional and spiritual processes work best as the result of expansive choices; choices that have the effect of increasing potentiality. Emotional and spiritual dynamics (a context of experience) cannot be attained or realized (will not ever be realized) as a target of any goal-driven activity, technology, process, or technique. They will never be achieved by any amount of practice and effort.

Only out of potentiality (nurturing gentleness), and that which is unconditioned and unconstrained, may joy, happiness, and love arise. Joy, happiness, and love, cannot ever be a goal.  
They cannot be made; they can only **<u>be</u>**.

### Healing

All healing involves touch and connection. Healing is contact. One heals through touching; whether it be touching with the hands, with a scalpel, or with the soul. When there is contact — touching — healing will happen.

All forms of healing are ultimately forms of re-connecting. To heal is to make hale, to make whole, to connect all parts of oneself into one integral being. Joy and health in life nurtures, accepts, loves, and integrates all parts of self and life well and fully. This is the nature of spirituality.

Healing is a growth. Growth and healing happen *between*. Like growth, healing does not have a source or an origin, personal or impersonal. Continuity underlies all dynamics and processes of growth.

Mind negates absence, separation, and discontinuity. Where there is conflict, disconnection, or discontinuity in the fabric of one's perceptual matrix (the collection of all beliefs), there will be emotion and pain, drawing attention and awareness to the disconnection.

Individually and culturally, one should always move attention and awareness into those areas which have pain and need to be healed. Acute situations are the result of persistently ignoring a chronic problem.

The correction for obsession is not suppression, but extension. To focus on only one person or only one aspect of life — and to include nothing else — is a painful discontinuity: attention is uneven and in some places, absent. The lack of attention itself results in increased potentiality for painful surprises and experiences ("Everything is sudden to those who are blind").

Healing involves a letting go of form and a return to feeling. Connection and integration will always create new potentials and choices.

Manifestation is the movement of feeling into form. Attaching to a specific form of manifestation is to realize disappointment. In creation and manifestation, the resulting realized form will always be different than expected. Creation is cooperative and always involves more than self.

To remain attached to only one specific form and to discard or reject all others is to suffer an obsession, and in this way, discontinuity and pain; the distribution of acceptance and awareness is not equi-tempered[[For example, a depressed person must let go of the expected form of realization of their love in order to return to the essence and deep inner nature of that love.]]. To let go of attachment to outer form allows for an acceptance of inner feeling (inner attachment). When the channels of feeling are opened, love can flow outward again and manifest as new and different forms.

The peak strength of the feelings and emotions aroused will be in proportion to both the acuteness of the conflict of one's commonly held ideas and beliefs and the degree of contextual importance with which those beliefs are involved in one's life.

The pattern, severity, and distribution of stress in the mind of self will define the pattern, severity, and distribution of conflict in one's life.

Difficulty in healing (the level of emotional intensity required) increases in proportion to the pervasiveness and fixedness of the involved ideologies, beliefs, ideas, and perceptions. The required subjective intensity, (and inversely, the probably of success of a healing) is proportional to the inertia associated with the structures of the mind needing to be changed. The greater the intensity (emotional force) and the lower the degree of fixation in the patterns of one's thoughts, the more effective the healing.

The more one's ideologies and beliefs are perceived 'Truths', the greater the degree of change in the state of consciousness — a change in the position of awareness — required to know them for certain as Actual Truths or to realize them as Beliefs deeply held.

The more that the perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies that one wants to change provide a common context for all of one's experiences in life, the greater the degree of abstractness, pervasiveness, and comprehensiveness of the efforts required to change them.

Where a blockage of emotion or a conflict of belief persists at a particular level of emotional intensity, the release of that blockage will require and involve a similar level of emotional intensity[[For example, the intensity necessary within the process of healing a traumatic experience will often need to be of a similar magnitude as that of the traumatic event itself. The difference between effective healing and an event of further pain is the context of safety, sacredness, knowledge, and awareness. In these cases, healing involves a special environment designed to handle that intensity; a context as much as a content.]].

The flexibility of mind increases, often suddenly, with increasing degrees of emotional intensity. All perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies, are changeable when there is sufficient intensity.

Healings which are infrequent, singular, and which are directed to ultimate causes are more effective than multiple efforts toward multiple symptoms. As with all growth, sufficient time and peacefulness must occur between significant changes to allow for real integration. Healings which are too frequent, or which attempt to change more than one basic condition at a time, can easily lead to complex interactions and unexpected side effects.

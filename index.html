<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Statement of Intent</h3>
<p>This book contains a distillation and summary of the most useful and practical ideas of the Immanent Metaphysics. These ideas are presented with the intent of enabling the reader to lead a more meaningful, healthy life. This book represents a personal search for those concepts believed to be of maximum value and usefulness in making effective choices. The intent is to provide the philosophical foundations necessary for people in western culture to enhance the quality of all life.</p>
<p>Rather than attempt to be a final work on the philosophy of choice, the aim of this book is to provide potent seed ideas and concepts for further reflection and development. The ideas presented herein are starting points for deeper consideration, meditation, and devolution. As a summary, this book contains only as much text as is needed to gracefully outline those notions which are of maximum significance and importance in the living of a high quality life. Emphasis on clarity and essence is inherent in this philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Format of Presentation</h3>
<p>In order to be of the greatest possible value, this book has been formatted as a series of related 'aphorisms'. An aphorism is a short and precise statement of an essential principle. Although the writing of aphorisms is not the usual prose form in philosophical literature, it has the significant advantage of ensuring clear access to the prime ideas and concepts of this philosophy. Individual aphorisms allow maximum emphasis on essentials while using a minimum of text.</p>
<p>As such, this book contains no exhaustive (and exhausting) explanations, metaphors or statements of implication. While such content might date understanding <em>in the short-term,</em> it can often result in long-term misunderstanding. Requiring the reader to wade through many histories, metaphors, an examples can obscure those essential concepts intended for immediate practical application.</p>
<p>Emphasis on a precise meaning is not to be construed as an attempt to logically prove the formal correctness of any of the assertions herein<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-001'>[1]</a>. This work is intended to provide maximum benefit to those who would actually <u>apply</u> these ideas. It is expected that the readers of this book will be interested in satisfying the immediate concerns of their daily lives.</p>
<p>This summary of seed ideas and concepts is not an attempt to "convince" anyone of anything. Readers looking to be convinced that some philosophical proposition is 'absolutely true' must do their own research to determine, prove, and validate their own notions of truth.</p>
<p>The process of learning and finding truth is more effective when one searches for what is true, rather than that which is false. It is of little use to "be convinced" of something, or to spend all of one's time trying to disprove or contradict some assertion. Such rejection is usually based on a misunderstanding, and thus fails to accomplish anything more than confusion. it is far more effective to consider the insight offered by each assertion in the manner in which that insight may be applied. It is hoped that the reader will recognize and eventually trust that there is a reason for every word of statement, every particularity of phrasing in these aphorisms.</p>
<div style='text-align: center; font-style: italic;'>
To search for meaning is to find it.<br/>
To fail to search for meaning is to be without it.

<li id='footnote-001'><p>It is expected that most readers would find little significance in speculating whether this book is momentarily satisfies the technical demands of a handful of abstract theorists. However, there is a formal basis and foundation for all of the content in this book. Readers who are interested in the deeper metaphysical dynamics underlying all of this material should contact the author for more information.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>A Reader's Covenant</h3>
<p>Beyond a certain natural point, a concept cannot be further simplified without damaging its essence. Most of the content herein has already been distilled to the maximum extent possible. Each word of each statement has been carefully considered and selected for maximum correctness and utility of meaning. The omission of a single word via misquoting, or even a slight change of ordering, can subtly damage and distort the intended meaning. Therefore, the author asks that the reader not attempt to simplify this material for presentation to others.</p>
<p>Distortions of significance (a loss of clarity when attempting to oversimplify an idea) can occur in ways that remain unnoticed, even though they eventually cause much misunderstanding, and if unchecked, mis-application. Therefore, the tendency (and the common desire) to simplify these concepts must be avoided. To realize the best possible long-term benefit of these ideas in our culture please <u>keep the aphorisms intact</u>.</p>
<h3>How to Read this Book</h3>
<p>The aphorisms in this manuscript refer to one another and are mutually interdependent. Some aspects of the meaning of each aphorism will only become clear when reading other areas of the text. As such, the reader is encouraged to always continue forward and develop comparisons, rather than to become 'stuck' at any particular point trying to understand one individual statement. The reader should <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong> expect to immediately comprehend all aspects of the various meanings and applications of each statement made. Reading through the entire manuscript more than once is necessary for complete understanding.</p>
<p>Although the aphorisms have been sequenced in such a manner as to encourage a gradual building of understanding and concept, there is no requirement that they be read in any specific order. The reader is encouraged to occasionally skip around and read those sections of the book that seem 'more interesting' in the moment.</p>
<p>Although you may skip sections to follow your interest, those sections that are chosen should be read very slowly, with total feeling and thoughtfulness. Do not try to 'skim' or read quickly through any part of this text. Approach each statement with full attention, when you are at peace of mind. Consider the complete and full meaning of each statement from several viewpoints before proceeding to the next.</p>
<p>By design, aphorisms implicitly contain several meanings and concepts in addition to those ideas more overtly stated. In most cases, individual assertions can be interpreted in more than one manner. Many of the statements presented here in have carefully-considered, multi-layered meanings. Wherever possible, each interpretation and connotation has been considered (and assured) to be metaphysically valid in many contexts.</p>
<p>Each individual aphorism is intended to be a basis for deep reflective consideration. Such meditation will reveal insights into concepts and aspects which are merely implied. It is better to read a little bit at a time, on some consistent interval, than to attempt to read many pages at one sitting. It is also helpful to meditate for a short interval both before and after reading any portion of this book.</p>
<p>In order to gain more value from the content, the reader is encouraged to consider each passage on several occasions, at varying times of the day and season. In re-reading, points which seemed confusing at first may become easier to understand. Some connections between ideas, reflections, and continuations will be known only when one has read far enough in the text to encounter alternate ends of the same thought.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Life</h2>
<h3>The Nature of Self</h3>
<p>Consciousness is.<br />
Consciousness is inseparable from all that is real and all that has being (both in parts and in wholes).</p>
<p>Choice is an intrinsic of consciousness.<br />
No one and no thing (nothing) can take away the reality and beingness of choice for any self, ever.<br />
Others may be able to influence what choices are apparently available; however, they cannot influence the fact that <u>self makes choice</u>.</p>
<p>Choice applies and is available to all of being, and all levels and aspects of being, for all time. There is no single level or 'unit' of being at which choice only applies, for all of self is involved in the action of choosing. There is no part or level of self which is without choice.</p>
<p>One's being, the eventity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-002'>[2]</a> of <strong>self</strong>, is the <u>product</u> of<br />
the sum of all of the choices that one has made, and<br />
the sum of all of the choices that one could make.</p>
<p>Self does not own or have choice; rather, self is the evolving context of many choices.<br />
The self arises our of the many common contexts of choice.<br />
The nature of choice is more basic, more fundamental, than the nature of self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-003'>[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Self (consciousness, mind) is neither the purely subjective, nor the purely objective; it is a dynamic of transformation, the boundary and interconnection between the inner subjective and the outer objective.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=2>
<li id='footnote-002'><p>The term <b>Eventity</b> refers to the combination of the meanings of an entity (thing) and an event. Each interaction, comparison, and being is an eventity.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-003'><p>Technically, a more correct assertion is that 'choice makes self' or that <u>choice has Self</u>. Self is an intrinsic of choice. The idea that 'self has or makes choice' is inaccurate since choice is not 'owned' or 'had' by the self so much as a singularity of self (the common context of selection) is the outcome of a plurality of choices.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>True Ownership</h3>
<p><strong>Law of True Ownership:</strong> "None can take from you that which you truly own".<br />
If someone or something can take some thing, some property, or some quality away, even in principle, then it was never truly owned; it is not a part of one's unique Self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-004'>[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Those things which are not Truly Owned are not owned at all.<br />
There can be no ownership of that which is external to oneself.</p>
<p>True ownership is not control. True ownership is not commercial.<br />
One cannot take true ownership, acquire it, give it away, or trade it for something else.</p>
<p>A <strong>Right</strong> refers to the potential to exercise any choice which is a direct enactment of the law of true ownership.</p>
<p>A <strong>Privilege</strong> refers to a/the potential to exercise a choice which requires the accommodation of another and which has been willingly granted by that other.</p>
<p>True ownership is a statement of right. It cannot be legislated.<br />
Only privileges can be legislated and traded commercially.</p>
<p>Self is always sovereign. The nature of the being of self is not and cannot ever be conditioned or constrained by anything or anyone.</p>
<p>No amount of external acceptance or validation will ever contribute to any degree of self-acceptance. To feel peace, one must accept oneself totally, fully, and unconditionally. This is the essence and the initiation of health, strength, integrity, and spirituality.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=4>
<li id='footnote-004'><p>Examples: Experience, choice, time, and validity are Truly Owned.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Absolute Inner Security</h3>
<p>Security is defined in terms of interaction. It is found in a potentiality to act, regardless of what could happen or has happened. To know true security is to realize the stability and sacredness of one's innermost spiritual nature. True security is intrinsic to self; it cannot be found in any world; it cannot be taken away. Personal security is absolute and truly owned.</p>
<p>Real security (the feeling that one will remain whole, strong, healthy, integral) is something that can only originate from inside the self. It cannot be provided by any other person or organization. External security is <strong><em><u>always</u></em></strong> illusionary; it has no value.</p>
<p>Inner personal security is not the same as protection. To attain absolute protection is to require absolute isolation; the loss of all connection. Absolute isolation can never be obtained, even in principle. Absolute protection requires the absence of all love and life, the loss of all value and significance. Real security, safety, integrity, strength, and health are found only in the Truth of one's ever-continuing ability to choose.</p>
<p>The feeling of security and strength is found in one's awareness of their freedom of choice. In that one cannot not choose, and in that the capability to choose cannot be taken away (it also is Truly Owned), one may always remain secure in choice. The greatest security is in the potential to act, rather than in the prevention of possible acts and events. In this is found the basis of all Faith.</p>
<p>Creation is safe. Choice is safe. All selves are ultimately safe in all worlds.</p>
<p>There is no single domain, world, or universe. No single domain is more fundamental than any other.</p>
<p>All worlds contain some degree of selfness. All selves will always have some positive (non-zero) degree of effective choice in that world. All effective choice will have causal consequences and implement real changes.</p>
<p>The core of self does not belong to any single domain; it is always a part of the process of many domains.<br />
The self is an axis upon which many worlds turn.</p>
<p>One cannot become entrapped in a domain of one's own imagination. It is always possible to transition to another world. The potentiality to transition to another world is Truly Owned.</p>
<p>No physical boundaries can protect one from the innermost nature of spirit. One does not have to protect oneself from divinity (spirit). There can be no Fear of God(dess(es)).</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Will</h2>
<h3>Aspects of Choice</h3>
<p>The essence of choice is resolved into exactly three necessary and sufficient concepts: potentiality, selection, and consequence. Without all of these, there is no choice (an impossible condition).</p>
<p>For choice to be choice, it must have consequences<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-005'>[5]</a>. A choice that has no effects, or whose effects can be completely undone, is not actually a choice at all; it is inherently an illusion.</p>
<p><em>All that is without choice, change, and consequence (causality) is illusion.</em><br />
Only that which is at once choice, change, and causality is <strong>real</strong>.</p>
<p>The strength of feeling that one has choice is the multiplicative product of:
1. the degree to which one perceives the range of options from which they can choose.
2. the degree that each option has actuality/consequence.
3. the degree that the selection of such option is perceived to be unconstrained.</p>
<p>Choice, as free will and self-determination, is realized in the feeling of choosing without external influence, without reason, without any logical compulsion. In part, all choices are based on a feeling of desire deep within the self. There will always be an aspect of personal choice which is not dictated by anything external to oneself.</p>
<p>The focus and strength of choice is at a maximum where attention is at maximum. The nature, range, and possible effects of choice are defined by the scale, position, and orientation of attention. A change in attention necessarily implies a change in the apparent choices available to self.</p>
<p>One can only make choices in the present. One cannot choose in the past or in the future. In that the overwhelming majority of one's being is here and now, so also are one's choices most effective here and now. Focus in the present concentrates the effectiveness of choice.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=5>
<li id='footnote-005'><p>When "not choosing" has real consequences and effects, it too must necessarily be considered a choice.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Limitation and Freedom</h3>
<p>One cannot have freedom; one can only give freedom.<br />
One does not own love or freedom; one may only participate in its flow and unboundedness.</p>
<p>To be free is to be aware of potentiality and choice. Limitation is the realization of actuality and consequence.</p>
<p>Limitation and freedom always occur together; they are inseparable. Freedom has an intrinsic, inherent, and irreducible aspect which is limitation. Limitation has an aspect which is freedom. Never does a freedom occur without a limitation, and never does a limitation occur without a freedom.</p>
<p>Limitation is as necessary as freedom. Beingness requires focus<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-006'>[6]</a>. Diversity, separateness, limitation, the unknown, and forgetfulness are all to be valued as much as singularity, oneness, freedom, limitlessness, and knowing.</p>
<p>All choice involves both freedom and limitation.</p>
<p>There is nothing which is absolutely free and there is nothing which is absolutely limited and fixed. The action of creation is a realization of freedom, yet all acts of creation inherently involve limitation<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-007'>[7]</a>.</p>
<p>There is no "transcendence" of limitation. One can work with limitations by adding to them: expanding freedoms by adding other levels, dimensions, and qualities.</p>
<p>The limitations, patterns, and forms created or defined <em><u>by</u></em> the self are not limitations, patterns or forms <em><u>of</u></em> the self. Self has being in many other worlds than the one where these patterns, limitations, and forms are manifested, structured, and defined.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=6>
<li id='footnote-006'><p>Consider, for example, the action of discipline. Accepting a practice of discipline (a limitation) eventually results in a freedom to achieve optimal self-expression. There can be no limitation where there is no freedom, and there can be no freedom where there is no limitation. In being, the realization of either of the concepts of freedom and limitation implies the realization of the other.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-007'><p>Action is composed of many changes. Creation is composed of many choices, and always involves an element of freedom. Limitation always involves an element of causality. In the same way that limitation and freedom are inseparable, choice, change, and causality are also inseparable. They always occur together.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Cooperative Choice</h3>
<p>All of choice is creative. Personal choice is the participation of self in the universal aspect of creation.</p>
<p>All choice is cooperative. Choice can only be given, never taken.<br />
Both creation and choice are necessarily and fundamentally cooperative.</p>
<p>No other person's choices, nor any consensus belief system, can compel, force, or constrain anyone to choose or believe anything in particular.</p>
<p>In the same manner that everything participates in change and causality, everything also has potentiality, possibility, and choice. One cannot choose in such a way that another cannot have choice. One cannot even choose not to have choice; to voluntarily 'not choose' is also a choice. Choice is Truly Owned.</p>
<p>Choice is not conserved, finite, or limited; the self cannot "run out of choice(s)".<br />
Creativity is not conserved; there is always more creativity and more choices.<br />
Every choice creates and enables other choices. Choice always begets choice.</p>
<p>Every choice is unique unto itself and can only be made once.</p>
<p>Choice cannot take away from the beingness of choice itself.<br />
Choice in the past can never reduce the amount or degree of choice in the present<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-008'>[8]</a>.</p>
<p>Choice cannot absolutely fix or limit other choices. Choice can only enable other choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is never any control over that which is internal to self.<br />
Desire has no reason and cannot be permanently constrained.<br />
There is no control over creativity. Creation itself is not controllable or constrainable.</p>
<p>No form of control is absolute; all process has some aspect of a cooperative nature. There is no control, there is only influence. It is fundamentally impossible to completely and/or absolutely control or constrain anything, in any domain, under any circumstances, ever.</p>
<p>There are always other possibilities, probabilities, and potentialities. Any potentiality can be made actual.</p>
<p>There cannot not continue to be creation and evolution in all worlds and in all domains. Creation is not an event. Creation is an aspect of events, rather than their source.</p>
<p>Nothing within a world can prevent the creation of new events, the creation of a new world. One relation cannot ultimately limit the beingness of other relations. Interaction cannot prevent interaction; it can only beget it.</p>
<p>All perception involves expression and all expression involves perception. In all the worlds in which one perceives and has feeling, there cannot not be a possibility of expression, a symbol and form of the self; a body projected as substance within that world. This symbol of mediation is the focus through which one expresses within that world. Where one perceives and has feeling, one cannot be fully silent (secret).</p>
<p>Creativity does not happen somewhere or to someone; rather it is inherently everywhere and within everyone. One does not need to "tap into" something external to oneself to create, to heal, to know something or to have imagination. In the very process of living, each of these qualities will take its own form.</p>
<p>Therefore, have faith in innate creativity and self-expression.<br />
Where creativity is needed, it is always inherently available.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=8>
<li id='footnote-008'><p>Choice can set the context of other choices. While this shift in context could be viewed as a partial limitation and constraint on other choices, it is a choice to view it in this manner — a hidden choice that must also be considered as contributing to the total 'volume' of choice available to self in the present.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Choice Coordination</h3>
<p>Self is not a thing, and it is not single, nor is it simple. Self (mind) cannot be defined or accumulated by any assembly of parts or theories. There is no 'unit' of self. A self is the product and integral synthesis of many aspects in natural communication.</p>
<p>All worlds are open and unbounded at the scale of the absolute microscopic, even while they must appear to be closed and bounded at the scale of the absolute macroscopic. All that enters into a world appears first at the microscopic limit<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-009'>[9]</a>. All creativity begins as a single event of interaction and co-incidence in the smallest scales, everywhere at once. All expression is an assembly of microscopic moments of intention.</p>
<p>The freedom of self to realize potential is directly related to the internal coherency, consistency, and continuity of that self. Where self is internally divided, there is much less freedom of choice.</p>
<p>The strength of a potentiality, or creative manifestation, is realized in the organization and coherency of many microscopic eventualities. The strength (energy) of a choice is proportional to the number of sub-choices in alignment necessary to bring about the actuality of consequence. Each alignment is itself a choice; a choice within a choice.</p>
<p>Change is not additive. Large, unbounded collections of 'insignificant small changes' can create overall effects far out of proportion to the apparent causes<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-010'>[10]</a>. The degree to which emergent, novel, and creative aspects are apparent is proportional to the degree to which there is a difference in scale between the mesoscopic<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-011'>[11]</a> scale (known) and microscopic (unknown).</p>
<p>Creation and creativity inherently involve the microscopic and the momentary potentiality. Small, incremental changes occurring everywhere at once are more conducive to creative expression than suddenly-realized 'grand sweeping events'.</p>
<p>The realization of choices at more encompassing levels of being is in the degree of the <em>coordination</em> of the choices which are distributed across the many selves of the encompassed levels of being<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-012'>[12]</a>.</p>
<p>The degree of individual freedom in a society increases dramatically in proportion to the degree of cooperation among individuals. A society or culture is strong to the degree that <em>everyone</em> is allowed to live creatively and live together.</p>
<p>A maximum of both acceptance and expression, unity and diversity, is necessary for a nation (society, tradition, religion, culture) to be strong. Diversity must be accepted and unity must be expressed. To have an expression of unity there must be an acceptance of diversity. To have an acceptance of diversity there must be an expression of unity. The strength of a nation is known as much through its flexibility and tolerance as through its commitments and follow-through.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=9>
<li id='footnote-009'><p>For example, the entrance of any new life (self) into a world always occurs through a single choice in multiple places (in the coincidence of at least two people). All birth begins at the smallest scale of existence.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-010'><p>This remains true, even though any small or bounded collection of microscopic eventualities will necessarily appear to have very little potentiality.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-011'><p><b>Mesoscopic</b>: middle scales; those ordinary ranges of size comparable to a human being.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-012'><p>For example, the realization of the choice to go to college is realized in a coordination (organization) of many smaller day-to-day choices to go to class, do one's homework, study, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Aphorisms of Love</h2>
<h3>The Nature of Love</h3>
<p>Love is an experience, an expression, and an understanding. It is the potentiality (essential quality) of all being. Where love is an experience it is a recognition, a knowing, and a realization of one's innermost feelings, dreams and desires. Love is potentiality, that pool of energy from which all desire, dreaming, and action is drawn. Where love is an expression it is the basis and the foundation of all emotion and desire (feeling).</p>
<p>Where love is an understanding, <em><u><strong>love</strong> is that which enables choice</u></em>. The quintessential meaning of Love refers to the quality of enabling and nurturing choice, joy, connectedness, and freedom. Love, in that it enables all life, significance, and choice, does not define or precondition being.</p>
<p>Love IS, and cannot not be. Love is unbound and formless. Love cannot be constrained, modified or conditioned by anything which exists. Love is always free, infinite, and giving of freedom.</p>
<p>Nothing which is in existence can prevent love from being loving. Nothing which has the nature of actuality can prevent the action of that which has the nature of potentiality, of creation.</p>
<p>As an energy, love is an emotion rather than a feeling. Energy, as a potentiality, is movement, and is, therefore, to be considered in terms of its intensity and direction rather than in terms of its quality<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-013'>[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Love is the most basic and fundamental emotion. Potentiality, desire, and energy are all intrinsic to all actuality, life, and being. Love is the energy and potentiality from which all other emotion, desire, want, and need, is drawn. All emotions have their root and ultimate basis in love.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the principle of love is unconditional (perfect). The dynamic of love (as "love of doing") is in no way dependent on any specific or particular form, detail, or quality. Love in being (as in "the being of love") is the principle of unconditional acceptance (also perfect).</p>
<p>Love has no opposite<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-014'>[14]</a>. Love is always the deepest and strongest emotion; stronger than fear, anger, or depression.</p>
<p>Love is always and forever given and received in a unique manner, with unique qualities. One cannot expect to receive love and nurturance in the same manner in which it is given.</p>
<p>Love has only the intention of giving. It is never about exchange or expectation. Love has no price; it cannot be bartered or exchanged for anything in the marketplace. Love can only arise as a natural dynamic of the potentiality, creativity, and evolution of being.</p>
<p>Love cannot be forced. It can never be conditioned or earned. Only respect can be earned and conditioned (to compel to be given).</p>
<p>Do something "good" that very few others can do and you <u>will</u> earn respect (an actuality to an actuality).<br />
Do not do something "bad" that nearly everyone one does, and you <em>might</em> be loved (a potentiality to a potentiality).</p>
<p>Respect is more meaningful when it is a reflection of one's actions (what one has done or is currently doing).<br />
Love is more meaningful when it is an acknowledgment of one's natural being (what one could potentially be).</p>
<p>One does not "have" love, one may only give it. No amount of the giving of love ever diminishes love or the potentiality of further love.</p>
<p>Love and choice are inherently unreasonable and illogical (non-causal). One can never be expected to give a reasonable or logical basis for one's values, desires, or creative decisions<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-015'>[15]</a>. Love is best understood and enacted in life in terms of significance, rather than structure, purpose, reason, or monetary value.</p>
<p>Divinity is best known by both love and gratitude. The action of <strong>Love</strong> is to give potentiality (to the world). The action of <strong>Gratitude</strong> is to receive potentiality (from the world).  One feels gratitude and allows a feeling of thankfulness when one accepts and has acceptance. The action of love and gratitude is the action of spirituality, of connecting oneself with the divine.</p>
<p>Love is an acceptance in giving, receiving, and feeling. The movement of love is a movement of self, a flow of potentiality from oneself to another self, a flow of feeling, thought, and perception.</p>
<p>To know love, one must participate in its unbounded flow.<br />
Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.</p>
<p>In that love is unconditional, acceptance is also unconditional. The effective realization of either unconditional love or unconditional acceptance necessarily implies the effective realization of the other.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term 'acceptance' is not the same as "to give up one's own choice". Acceptance and choice are distinct concepts. Choice is not acceptance. Acceptance is not choice. Acceptance is ultimately not a choice (eventually, everyone must accept at least something). Acceptance is about perception, the integration of perceptions into self. In contrast, choice is about expression. Both are necessary in one's own life.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=13>
<li id='footnote-013'><p>The experience of "feeling love" (as a quality) is a reflection of one's desire and in this way is a recognition of potentiality. To consider the 'feeling of love' (rather than the potentiality of love) is to consider a <i>combination</i> of the energy of desire with a significant and personally meaningful quality. It is the added energy of desire and potentiality that encourages one to regard some feelings <u>as love</u> rather than as a feeling of something else.</p><p>The perfectly clear channel of unconditional acceptance (perfect love, which has no quality of feeling in itself) will be considered to have a subtle quality of feeling in direct proportion to the degree that some qualities, feelings, and experiences are regarded as easier to accept and integrate than others. It is in this way that the feeling of love is realized and known to the finite self as a feeling rather than as an unqualified perfection of potentiality. As one's spirituality expands and evolves, one's capacity to realize unconditional love also increases. Love is pure, and without particularity of feeling in proportion to the degree of one's spirituality.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-014'><p>It is a misconception to think that 'hate' is the opposite of love; hate is only a distorted expression of love. hate has the strong intention and expectation of changing someone or something external to self in a manner which is either unconscious or covertly manipulative. Hate is a characterization of anger, and is thus secretly driven by love. The absence of love is not hate, but apathy.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-015'><p>To the degree that one is able to give a 'reason' for their love, one is expressing a statement of <u>purpose</u>. Defining a relationship in terms of purpose is to describe a business transaction rather than an intimate and inherently meaningful connection. A statement of purpose is not a statement of value; it has no inherent significance. All life is lost when feeling, desire, and love are regarded as without value or significance.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Nature of Desire</h3>
<p>Love in its most abstract and <em>impersonal</em> sense is pure potentiality, pure energy without quality or form.<br />
Self in its most abstract and <em>personal</em> sense is pure quality without energy or form.</p>
<p>Desire is the combination and synthesis of the quality of self with the energy of love. Ultimate desire is the synthesis of the unlimited expansiveness of impersonal love and the infinitely detailed nature of one's innermost personal quality.</p>
<p>Desire is at once the basis for all choice, the potentiality to choose, and the selectivity of those choices.</p>
<p>Desires are interrelated. They do not occur in isolation and are interdependent with other desires.</p>
<p>Desires have various degrees of depth. Some desires are formed as an implementation of a deeper desire. The knowledge, resolution, and attainment of deeper desires will often decrease the intensity of many other surface desires.</p>
<p>Surface desires are often conflicted; one's deepest desires are never conflicted.</p>
<p>The meaning of a surface desire is clarified when its foundation in deeper desire is known. When surface desires appear to be in conflict, the knowledge and realization of one's deeper desires will always resolve that conflict.</p>
<p>When desires are confused (i.e., are internally conflicting or are unclear), or when one has conflicting ideas and beliefs, one has effectively become two smaller selves, each of which has significantly less freedom of choice.</p>
<p>One chooses most effectively when choosing as a unified self as a whole being, with attunement and at-one-ment with one's own innermost (deepest) desires.</p>
<h3>The Basal Motivations</h3>
<p><strong>The Basal Motivations of All Life:</strong> There are two ultimate desires inherent in all being:</p>
<ul>
<li>The desire to create and be creative (the expression of self-quality).</li>
<li>The desire to experience and have experiences (the perception of form).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most basic desire inherent in all consciousness is to maximize the degree (quantity), diversity (quality), and intensity of both the creative experience and the experience of creativity.</p>
<p>The ultimate purpose of evolution is to simultaneously maximize the degree of experience and creativity of all aspects of life, in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>The basal motivations are at the foundation of all desire and all cognition. Together they are the basis for and foundation of all love, life, growth, evolution, transformation, interaction, communication, learning, experimentation, being, and doing.</p>
<p>Creativity is expressive. It has its basis in potentiality.<br />
Experience is perceptive. It has its basis in actuality.<br />
Both actuality and potentiality need to be maximized for the full realization of life.<br />
Quality is as important as quantity. Potentiality is as important as actuality.</p>
<p>To maximize actuality (quantity) is to maximize experience and clear acceptance;<br />
the integrity of self, world, and symmetry in the relations between self and world.<br />
To maximize potentiality (quality) is to maximize nurturing choice and expression;<br />
the creativity of self, world, and continuity in the relations between self and world.</p>
<p>Creativity and experience are at a maximum when the greatest possible degree of the combination of static and dynamic aspects are realized. A maximum intensity of action occurs where elements of dynamic choice and creativity are intimately combined with elements of stable causality and experience.</p>
<p>All natural selection seeks to maximize both potentiality/creativity/evolution and actuality/experience/interaction. Optimal changes are ones which maximize the realization of future choices and the manifestation of past causality.</p>
<h3>Desire, Want, and Need</h3>
<p>Love has three aspects: Desire, want, and need.<br />
These aspects refer to the quality, form, and intensity of love respectively.<br />
Want, need, and desire are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.<br />
Each has its place, value, and validity.</p>
<p>The meaning of want, need, and desire are distinguished by where they arise and where they are realized. Considering the self as a conduit of connection between spirit and matter, soul and body:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desires</strong> are feelings that arise within the soul to affect the self.<br />
  They can only be realized from within the soul (an aspect of spirit).</li>
<li><strong>Needs</strong> arise within the self and can only be realized within the self (an aspect of mind).</li>
<li><strong>Wants</strong> come from the outer world and arise within the body to affect the self.<br />
  They can only be realized within or through the body (an aspect of world).</li>
</ul>
<p>Wants, needs, and desires are abstractions of thoughts, feelings, and emotions respectively.<br />
They are instructions<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-016'>[16]</a> of purpose, value, and meaning respectively.<br />
A life must realize all three, in proper balance, to be complete.</p>
<p>The realization of a feeling occurs in the same location and depth of self as that from which it arose.<br />
The satisfaction of a feeling is always a return to the origin of that feeling<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-017'>[17]</a>.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=16>
<li id='footnote-016'><p>'Ab-stract' as "out of form". 'In-struct' as "into form".</p></li>
<li id='footnote-017'><p>Feelings, thoughts, and emotions are not just aspects of that part of self known as 'mind' but as aspects of <i>all</i> of self. For example, feeling arise in the soul, the self, and the body.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Effective Choice</h3>
<p>An <strong>Effective choice</strong> is one that results in the realization and manifestation of desire<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-018'>[18]</a>.</p>
<p>The most effective choices are those which maximally support creativity and experience in the world, in the self, and in the dynamics between them.</p>
<p>An ultimately effective choice is one which realizes (manifests) the ultimate desires of all that is making that choice and all that is affected by that choice.</p>
<p>The ultimate innermost nature of self/soul is good. Ineffective actions and choices result from a lack of clarity between the soul and the mind. To have a lack of clarity is to have a lack of knowing and of understanding; it is an absence of wisdom.</p>
<p>To improve one's knowing and understanding is to increase clarity within the self, the effectiveness of one's choices, and the degree to which one experiences joy/happiness. Those who choose ineffectively can be nurtured and healed by enabling them to increase their degree of knowledge and understanding (i.e., teaching by example).</p>
<p>The most effective choices provide or result in the greatest degree of wholeness and integrity of both self and world (necessary for experience), while at the same time allowing for the greatest freedom to make additional future choices for oneself and others (necessary for creativity).</p>
<p>The degree of effectiveness of one's choices is proportional to the product of the degree to which one's choices and their results, coherently maintain, sustain, enhance, and nurture:</p>
<ol>
<li>the integrity and wholeness (the actuality and actualization) of the world, the self, and the relation between world and self.</li>
<li>the potentiality/realization/evolution of creativity and experience in all of life, including one's own life (the degree to which it potentiates other choices).</li>
</ol>
<p>Perception is effective to the degree that it is dispassionate, without judgment, precondition, or expectation.</p>
<p>Expression is effective to the degree that it is passionate — a reflection of one's dreams and inspiration — and is a clear manifestation of one's highest hopes and aspirations.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=18>
<li id='footnote-018'><p>Note: Effectiveness is defined in terms of desire rather than in terms of either want or need.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Aphorisms of Mind</h2>
<h3>Emotions, Thoughts, and Feelings</h3>
<p>Emotions, thoughts, and feelings are distinct<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-019'>[19]</a>, inseparable, and non-interchangeable aspects of mind. Feelings are not emotions. Thoughts are not feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>emotion</strong> refers to a strength, direction, and flow of energy in the mind.<br />
  Emotion is the intensity and the direction of the flows of expression and experience.</li>
<li>Each <strong>thought</strong> refers to a form, structure, or pattern of perception or expression.<br />
  Thoughts refer to an energy of the self which has become fixed in form.<br />
  Thoughts are the form, pattern, and structure of the flows of mind.</li>
<li>Each <strong>feeling</strong> refers to a quality of energy, regardless of its direction, form or intensity of the flow in mind.<br />
  Feelings refer to qualities, timbres, and colors of one's experiences and expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To discuss emotion is to discuss only the intensity and direction of the flow of one's mind.<br />
To discuss thought is to discuss only the form, pattern, and structure of those flows.<br />
To discuss feeling is to discuss only the quality, timbre, and color of those flows.</p>
<p>Emotions are experienced in terms of intensity. Thoughts are experienced in terms of form and quantity. Feelings are experienced in terms of color and quality.</p>
<p>Emotions are ultimate, basic and simple, whereas thoughts and feelings are inherently complex.</p>
<p>Emotions are considered in terms of their power and intensity.<br />
The self which experiences these emotions is considered in terms of strength.</p>
<p>Thoughts are mostly structure and have very little energy (static).<br />
Emotions are mostly energy (very dynamic) and have little structure.<br />
Neither thought, pattern, form, nor energy are in themselves quality.</p>
<p>Emotion is the energy that moves the self, moves through the self, or moves from the self.<br />
Emotions are the potentialities by which changes may be made in the dynamics of self.</p>
<p>Emotion (energy) changes thought, perception, and expression. Desire (feeling) shapes the power of emotion (its direction of expression and intensity) and emotion is the basis by which thought is shaped within the mind. All perception and expression is itself a process of emotion.</p>
<p>One cannot have feelings without thoughts and emotions.<br />
One cannot have thoughts without also having emotions and feelings.<br />
One cannot have emotions without also having thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>One must (cannot not) have feelings. Feelings are. Similarly, one cannot not have emotions and thoughts.</p>
<p>The degree to which the soul evolves is in proportion to the degree to which the self continues to choose to be aware of, is aware of, and consciously experiences feeling.</p>
<p>Emotion influences thinking and feeling; thinking influences feeling and emotion; feeling influences emotion and thinking.</p>
<p>Each thought is a static result, a distillation of a specific aspect of one's perception. Thinking is a process of change in, and transformation of, perception. Thinking intrinsically involves energy. The emotions of one's mind are the flow of changes in thought, perception, and thinking, even as one's thoughts confine and direct the flow of emotion and change<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-020'>[20]</a>.</p>
<p>Thoughts are static; feelings are dynamic. Feelings can only change.<br />
Feelings are never purely chosen or conditioned.</p>
<p>One's feelings cannot be controlled by anything internal or external to oneself. The feelings that one has are never causal or reasonable or logical; or just the result of only causal, logical, or reasonable processes.</p>
<p>Nothing in the world can force or condition one to feel a certain way or to have a specific feeling with predictable and definite qualities. One's feelings are always personal, Truly Owned by oneself.</p>
<p>Where there is perception, experience, or causality, there is also expression, choice, and change.<br />
All of life (all beingness at all scales of all domains) must grow, expand, and become more.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=19>
<li id='footnote-019'><p>Western culture has a tendency to confuse emotion and feeling. They are not the same. As a metaphor, to consider a beam of light in terms of its direction and intensity (emotion) is not to consider it in terms of its color (feeling).</p></li>
<li id='footnote-020'><p>Emotions are like the flow of a river. The course of a river is at once shaped by its banks (thought shapes emotion) even as the river gradually shifts those banks (over time, the course of a river changes).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Dynamics of Emotion</h3>
<p>Emotions are "the energy that moves the mind" (as e-motion). They literally power, or give strength to, one's thoughts.</p>
<p>Emotion has a reasonable and orderly pattern, connected to our choices, intentions, and inner nature. Emotion is the energy that moves the mind of self.</p>
<p>There are five basic and primary emotions. These are the foundation from which all other emotions are derived. They are love, fear, anger, frustration, and depression. These five emotions occur in definite patterns and are related to a specific occurrence of thoughts, perceptions, and feelings.</p>
<p>Emotion is a reasonable and natural dynamic of life which ultimately increases consciousness, quality, and significance. Awareness of fear, anger, frustration, or depression is an opportunity to restore the quality of life and maintain health.</p>
<p>Love is the first and most primal emotion. All emotional dynamics begin with love, and always ultimately have love at their root. Love is the pool of potential energy which is at the basis of all spirit.</p>
<p>Love is that which enables choice. Love is undifferentiated potentiality at the subjective core (soul) of all being. It is a spiritual energy which moves in all directions at once.</p>
<p>The innate, innermost nature of self (soul) has the being of unconditional love. In being unconditional love <strong>is</strong>, and is ultimately associated with the soul. The absolute inner nature of self is ultimately 'good', regardless of surface manifestations.</p>
<p>Love becomes fear when there is a perception, thought, or belief of the possibility for loss of something or someone that is valued, significant, desired, or loved.</p>
<p>Fear is a flow of energy (from soul and spirit toward mind), which is directed towards the core of the incarnate body to enable the self to act. Fear is felt near the center of self. Fear awakens consciousness and focuses attention in being; it makes one aware of the need for action.</p>
<p>There is no fear that is not fear of loss. The degree of fear is in direct proportion to the degree of significance of the perceived loss. There can be no fear where there is no love. As such, the emotion of fear is never stronger than love; love is always stronger than fear. The intensity of one's fear is an indication of the significance of the love which defines it.</p>
<p>Fear always has at its basis a perception of the potential loss of something valued, important, and meaningful (something or someone loved). Through a recognition of the basis of fear one is returned to the root emotion (love).</p>
<p>Fear becomes anger when there is a perception, thought, or belief that it is the world — rather than the self — which must change; that no amount of change or action within oneself can prevent the possibility of loss.</p>
<p>Anger (when unconscious, reacting) and passion (where conscious, acting in a healthy and integrated manner) are flows of energy direction from the mind into the external world to enable (or catalyze) the world to act and change. Both passion and anger potentiate change and action on the part of that which is other than self. It is an attempt by the self to enable someone or something else to act, choose, and change on the behalf of self.</p>
<p>All anger finds its strength and basis in fear. All passion finds its strength and basis in love. Where there is no desire, there can be no passion.</p>
<p>An angry person has consciously forgotten what they really care about and who or what they truly love. A passionate person remembers what the angry person has forgotten<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-021'>[21]</a>.</p>
<p>Anger always has, at its basis, fear. Anger is a desire to change the outside world. To truly know what one wishes to change and why, is to recognize the fear at the root of anger.</p>
<p>Anger becomes frustration when there is a perception, thought, or belief that change in the world is not actually occurring; that no amount of personal action will effect change in the world, and that the possibility of loss will become an actuality of loss.</p>
<p>Frustration is the experience of a blockage in personal energy directed outward. It occurs when passion (or anger) is perceived to be ineffective, resisted, or confined. Frustration is a reflection of an initial failure to satisfy underlying concerns, desires, loves, needs, or wants. Frustration is blocked anger or passion. It is a (believed to be) temporary disconnection in the flow between self and world.</p>
<p>Frustration always has, at its basis, blocked energy. It manifests in the perception that there is something external to self which acts in opposition to one's desire.</p>
<p>Frustration becomes depression when there is a perception, thought, or belief that no change is significant; that a loss has actually occurred and that it is permanent; that changes in self or world would make no difference.</p>
<p>Depression is characterized by the belief that no amount of action will make any difference. Where there is no choice, spirit departs from the body, and the mind becomes empty (without thinking) and insensitive (without feeling). Depression is a blockage in the flow of energy (the connection) between soul and self. Depression is an isolation and aloneness of self, a being cut off from both inner spirit (personal dreams and innate significance) and the outer world (other people).</p>
<p>Depression always has, at its basis, a feeling of powerlessness. It manifests as a lack of energy (apathy) to make changes which are important, valued, and meaningful.</p>
<p>The greater the degree of love, significance, and value, and the clearer and more sudden the perception (belief) of possible loss, the stronger and more intense the resulting emotions of fear, anger, and depression.</p>
<p>The more the cause of a potential loss is perceived to be external, the more rapid the transition from love to fear and from fear to anger. The intensity of fear and anger is proportional to the strength of the source of emotion of love.</p>
<p>The degree, depth, and duration of frustration and depression is proportional to the intensity and strength of the original love and the degree of perceived ineffectiveness of any possibility of change.</p>
<p>An enlightened person has learned to use an awareness of their emotions as an indication and reminder of what is truly loved, valued, and desired. In this way, strong emotions (rather than being a hindrance) are effective tools of change and consciousness. Emotions provide a clear path to knowing what one loves; a true knowledge of self.</p>
<h3>Principles of Change</h3>
<p>With respect to one's subjective time in any domain (world), the <u>rate of change</u> is proportional to the degree that one's focus of attention is internal, and is inversely proportional to the degree that one's focus of attention is external.</p>
<p>Within the self, change occurs only when there is attention and commitment.<br />
Within the world, change occurs only when there is an <u>absence</u> of attention and commitment.</p>
<p><em>Within the self,</em> a focus of attention (awareness of choice) begets change, at the location of that focus. The more that one focuses attention on that which is internal, the more quickly change will be realized. Those things which are observed as being most within, or which are the most microscopic, will have the greatest rates of change relative to one's natural subjective sense of time.</p>
<p><em>Within the world,</em> a focus of attention (awareness of causality) halts change, at the location of that focus. The more that one focuses attention on that which is external, the more slowly change will be realized. Those things which are observed as being the most without, or which are the most macroscopic, will have the slowest rates of change relative to one's natural subjective sense of time.</p>
<p>A focus of attention on quality (feelings) increases dynamicism (change; decreases permanence).<br />
A focus of attention on quantity (thought, form) increases staticism (decreases change).</p>
<p>The degree to which it seems that there are many subjective moments for each objective moment (i.e., the degree that one 'lives life fully') is proportional to the degree to which the dynamics of one's life involves many full transitions of context, state, and orientation. The strength of this effect increases in proportion to the degree that each transition involves many qualities, feelings, and levels of depth within the self and that these transitions are varied, significant, and novel (unique).</p>
<p>The degree to which one's subjective experience of time seems to be exceeded by that of the objective experience of the world (that 'time passes quickly') is proportional to the degree that there is an absence of change, novelty, quality, and richness in the dynamics of one's life. This will occur when one experiences life using only one level of consciousness, without any changes in context, state or orientation; and when one interacts with the world only in terms of purpose, structure, form, rather than in terms of significance, sacredness, and feeling.</p>
<p>Awareness is a coordination of choice; it inherently involves potentiality and energy. Awareness of a feeling or thought changes it. Nothing which is internal to oneself — and which remains in one's focused attention – will remain unchanged. The maximum degree of choice and change is possible at the location of the focus of attention.</p>
<p>To experience a change in feeling, one must fully experience feeling. The degree that one's feelings change is directly proportional to the degree that one experiences them with clarity. Feelings change with our awareness and attention. Feelings that are given no attention (are suppressed or held back from one's experience of the present moment) do not change. They will remain constant until experienced fully at the level of self from which they arise.</p>
<p>By changing many thoughts, one changes a single quality of feeling.<br />
By changing many feelings, one changes each emotion.<br />
By changing many emotions, one changes a single thought.</p>
<h3>Intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>Thinking</strong> is the changing of relations in perception. Thinking is the process of change in the organization of an individual's perception. A <strong>Thought</strong> is a single, specific change in the organization of perception. An <strong>idea</strong> is the relationship between sets of perceptions. A <strong>concept</strong> is a relationship between multiple ideas.</p>
<p>The apparent degree of <strong>intelligence</strong> is in proportion to the rate of change of relations in perception (insight). Changes in relations of perception are to be understood in terms of <u>span</u> and <u>depth</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Span</strong> refers to the number of perceptions and the degree of the dissimilarity of the perceptions which are changed in any given domain of perception (thinking/existence).</li>
<li><strong>Depth</strong> refers to the number and dissimilarity (in terms of degrees of abstraction) of the domains in which those changes of perception occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of intelligence is considered in terms of the depth, clarity, and rapidity of those changes. The quantity of intelligence is proportional to the degree that one's perceptions and thoughts are transformed into other perceptions and thought, and is inversely proportional to the time required to implement those transformations. The greater the degree of the change in perception, the greater the number of ways in which that change occurs, and the more rapidly the change occurs, the greater the degree of intelligence.</p>
<p>Clarity is the basis of discipline in thinking. In the practice of spirituality, philosophy, and art, <u>clarity</u>, not simplicity, is the more essential value. To speak and write with elegance and grace is not to be demonstrably simple, as much as it is to be profoundly clear.</p>
<p>The concepts of simplicity and clarity are distinct, even though they may often appear in the same context.</p>
<p>To be clear is to allow creation. The ability to realize creation and creativity increases with one's clarity and transparency; a form of silence, emptiness, and potentiality.</p>
<p>Creativity decreases when there is an emphasis on simplicity rather than on essence. Events of greater degrees of synthesis and complexity have stronger aspects of creation/creativity. Evolution only happens where there is complexity and where that complexity increases.</p>
<p>Clarity is necessary to maintain an open mind and to perceive deep truths. An effective person will frequently examine implicit, hidden assumptions and expectations. When one releases expectations, it often becomes possible to gain new and valuable insights.</p>
<p>To be effective, proceed with an emphasis on clarity of essence. Do not submit to the desire or drive for simplicity of appearance.</p>
<p>Effectiveness in thinking is proportional to the degree that the desire and value for diversity, dynamicism, complexity, clarity, and asymmetry, is equal to the desire for simplicity, symmetry, and permanence.</p>
<p>Communication is reality. The synthesis of multiple perspectives is greater than their sum. The self which is knowledgeable about many worlds has greater wisdom in each of them.</p>
<p>Just as the synthesis of multiple languages grants the speaker a deeper knowing (including a knowing of the essential nature of language), so also does the use of multiple levels, channels, and interchanges of interaction with a reality grant a deeper knowing (including a knowing of the essence of reality). The depth of such knowing obtained is greater than the sum of its components.</p>
<p>To be able to think within and about a multiplicity of different languages is important. The choice of the language (assumptions, subjective context) used in one's consideration has a profound effect on the trend and effectiveness of one's thinking.</p>
<h3>Learning and Memory</h3>
<p><strong>Learning</strong> is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of a perception.<br />
<strong>Evolution</strong> is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of life.</p>
<p>To learn is to organize attention. To be wise is to organize intention.<br />
To have learning (to have knowing) is to have organized attention (a process of being/perception).<br />
Understanding is the result of organized expression.</p>
<p>The process of learning is a movement, a transition of the boundary of self, of attention and awareness expanding outward. Learning is a transition form 'working with' to 'working through'.</p>
<ul>
<li>One <strong>works with</strong> something that one regards as external to oneself.</li>
<li>One <strong>works through</strong> something that one regards as an extension of one's own being, as a part of oneself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole of one's learning affects each choice, each perception. A collection of choices (perceptions) defines one's attention (awareness). To learn something one must organize one's attention, which in itself requires a consistent pattern of choices. To make a choice is to apply the whole of one's learning.</p>
<p>Within any one particular orientation of consciousness, the accuracy of memory is improved by the use of discrete correspondences and patterns of relationship (forms). Qualities (feelings) are retained in memory by first converting (binding) them to discrete patterns and forms.</p>
<p>Clarity of one's memory is diminished by rapid changes in one's state of consciousness in proportion to their rapidity and suddenness. Clarity of memory is also diminished by significant transitions from feeling-oriented consciousness to form-oriented consciousness, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Continuity of memory (the sequence of subjective experience) depends on a continuity of consciousness (the maintaining of a similar state of mind). When one forgets (a form of discontinuity), it is often a signal that the context of mind, the state of one's consciousness, has changed.</p>
<p>The degree that one retains memory across the transition of a state of consciousness is inversely proportional to the suddenness of that transition. For the maximum transfer of information with minimum distortion from one state of consciousness to another, one language or world to another, one self to another, a proportional match must be made between the frequency and density of each state, each language<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-022'>[22]</a>.</p>
<p>The degree of clarity associated with a memory (perception) is directly proportional to the degree of similarity of feeling in one's subjective context (perceiver) and to the degree of proximity of form in the objective content (perceived).</p>
<p>The process of learning, as well as the process of evolution, life, and conversation, is as dependent on forgetting as it is on remembering. One has to 'remember' and build upon past memories and learning. Yet, one must also 'forget' the myriad details and 'fine choices' required for each action to become free and make use of the learning gained.</p>
<p>The limitation of habitual action at one level of being is a freedom of unconstrained action in other levels of being. Habituation and unconsciousness are as important and valued to self as are the immediacy of awareness and consciousness. In habituation, the choices that are made become automatic, and <em>stay</em> made, so that one does not have to 're-choose' the same details over and over again<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-023'>[23]</a>.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=21>
<li id='footnote-021'><p>A person who is only conscious of their anger tends to make very poor choices. They are ineffective at changing a situation so that it accurately supports that underlying desire (enabling a return to love). They are reacting rather than acting or responding. The expression of love is distorted in anger.</p><p>Passionate expression, in contrast, tends to be more conscious and pure, supporting and enabling all concerned to realize significance and return to love. Passion is effective to the extent that it realizes love with clarity and intensity (without distortion).</p></li>
<li id='footnote-022'><p>This may often be facilitated by the deliberate introduction of several intermediate stages (languages, states of consciousness, etc). Calibrate each added state to closely match the preceding and succeeding ones.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-023'><p>This choice to focus awareness is no different than the choice that the mind makes to omit a distracting 'complete and thorough awareness of every minute detail required of one's body to walk across the room'. When one learns to walk, or to ride a bike, the process of this action becomes automatic for precisely the same reasons. It enables one to be able to focus on other things, like the scenery that one is walking through. States of consciousness, one's beingness within a world, become defined and fixed by choices of the same nature.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Habits of Mind</h3>
<p>A <strong>belief</strong> refers to a structure of mind that:</p>
<ol>
<li>acts as a filter (transformation operator) of one's perceptions and knowing.</li>
<li>acts as a predisposition (instruction operator) in one's understanding and expression.</li>
</ol>
<p>The notion of 'a belief' is similar to that of a presumption; both have a ubiquitous, unconscious nature. A belief is an unconscious or subconscious choice. Beliefs are similar to (and are usually encoded as) thoughts, ideas, and concepts. When beliefs are fixed and unchanging (unchangeable, non-dynamic), they may have characteristics and effects similar to those of prejudice.</p>
<p>Beliefs (structures of mind) exist and have interdependencies at varying levels of depth. Some beliefs reside at deeper contextual levels, providing the foundations upon which other beliefs are conceived and used.</p>
<p>All structures of mind are interdependent, with varying degrees of asymmetry. The deeper structures of soul are more subjectively stable and persistent than those nearer the mind, which are more transient.</p>
<p>The depth of a belief is proportional to the number of situations in which that belief applies; the more the belief is a part of the subjective context. The deepest beliefs are those which form the ubiquitous assumptions and taken for granted truths which apply in nearly all situations. They are the foundations upon which many other beliefs are built.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Health</h2>
<h3>Joy and Pain</h3>
<p><em>First parallel aspect:</em><br />
One has an experience of <strong>joy</strong> when one perceives and increase in one's potentialities.<br />
Events and choices which increase apparent freedom, are expansive, and decrease feelings of limitation.<br />
These events will tend to result in experiences and feelings of joy.</p>
<p><em>Second parallel aspect:</em><br />
One has an experience of <strong>pain</strong> when one perceives a decrease in one's potentialities.<br />
Events and choices which decrease apparent freedoms, are constrictive, and increase feelings of limitation.<br />
These events will tend to result in experiences and feelings of pain.</p>
<p>Joy and Pain are both real.</p>
<p>Pain is typically literal, factual, and objective, and is found by going into the deep world (reality).<br />
Joy is typically symbolic, mythical, and subjective, and is found by going into the deep Self.<br />
To shift from the mythical to the factual is to decrease potential and experience pain.<br />
To shift from the factual to the mythical is to increase potential and express joy.</p>
<p>Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow. These events decrease apparent potentiality. All pain is a reflection (a realization) of discontinuity. Pain occurs when there is a break, breach, or sudden change.</p>
<p>Joy corresponds to the potentiality of events of connection, continuity, and union.<br />
These are events which increase the feeling of potentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Humor:</strong> the ability to create and convey an immediate, vivid, and unexpected expansive shift in the interpretation and significance.<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-024'>[24]</a></p>
<p>Joy and pain are not opposites; they are complementary aspects of a deeper whole. They have the same relationship to each other that potentiality has with actuality. They are both found in proportion to the intensity of the self-to-world interaction. Where the degree of the intensity of the interaction between self and world changes, there will be (cannot not be) either joy or pain or both.</p>
<p>An experience of joy does <u>not</u> result in or require an experience of pain. Nor does it make one any more or less likely to experience pain. Nor does the actuality of an experience of pain make the potentiality of an experience of joy any more likely. It is never "necessary for balance" to have equal degrees of experience of joy and pain. One does not need to experience pain to experience joy. Even a large amount of pain will not necessarily result in or imply that one will have even a very small amount of joy. The one does <u>not</u> necessitate the other. There is no glory in suffering!</p>
<p>One cannot increase or decrease the potentiality of either joy or pain without also increasing or decreasing the potentiality of the other.</p>
<p>To increase the potentiality of joy, one must increase the actuality of the intensity of interaction. Without the vivid connectedness of interaction, there can be no joy.</p>
<p>Where communication, connection, continuity and communion are fundamentally cooperative processes, and cannot be forced, only strengthened, so also one cannot force, guarantee, or ensure an experience of joy. One's ability to experience joy is proportional to the strength of one's willingness to remain present in the potentialities of the unknown.</p>
<p>One <u>cannot guarantee</u> that joy, happiness, or love will follow as the result of any process, conditioning, practice, or method. No religion, tradition, technology or practice can ever specifically create, force or guarantee that one will experience joy, bliss, satisfaction or happiness, or that one will not ever experience pain, suffering, or loss. The qualities of joyful experience can only be nurtured, not ensured.</p>
<p>To allow and nurture joyfulness will make joy a more likely experience in life. Spirituality (acceptance) and the enactment of love (nurturance) enable and increase the potentiality that one will experience joy.</p>
<p><em>First parallel aspect:</em> Mental and physical processes work best as the result of constrictive choices; choices that have the effect of limiting potentiality. Specific mental and physical states (a context of experience) can be attained as the result of a goal-driven activity. They can be achieved with practice and effort.</p>
<p><em>Second parallel aspect:</em> Emotional and spiritual processes work best as the result of expansive choices; choices that have the effect of increasing potentiality. Emotional and spiritual dynamics (a context of experience) cannot be attained or realized (will not ever be realized) as a target of any goal-driven activity, technology, process, or technique. They will never be achieved by any amount of practice and effort.</p>
<p>Only out of potentiality (nurturing gentleness), and that which is unconditioned and unconstrained, may joy, happiness, and love arise. Joy, happiness, and love, cannot ever be a goal.<br />
They cannot be made; they can only <strong><u>be</u></strong>.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=24>
<li id='footnote-024'><p>The connection between joy and potentiality is experienced in all forms of humor. The essence of telling a good joke is the unexpected shift to an alternate interpretation, one which creates an expanded view of a situation. The shift to an alternate view, the recognition or creation of an absurdity, etc., are all expansive in comparison to one's initial understandings and expectations; they are implicitly perceived as an increase in potentiality; that there is more than one way—a choice—in how a situation may be perceived. The effectiveness of humor is in proportion to the novelty, immediacy, and vividness of the moment of expanded realization. As such, an experience of humor is recognized as being a momentary experience of joy; a moment expressed in laughter. As such, 'to have a sense of humor' is correctly recognized as a spiritual quality; an ability to accept more expansive interpretations of each situation.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>All healing involves touch and connection. Healing is contact. One heals through touching; whether it be touching with the hands, with a scalpel, or with the soul. When there is contact — touching — healing will happen.</p>
<p>All forms of healing are ultimately forms of re-connecting. To heal is to make hale, to make whole, to connect all parts of oneself into one integral being. Joy and health in life nurtures, accepts, loves, and integrates all parts of self and life well and fully. This is the nature of spirituality.</p>
<p>Healing is a growth. Growth and healing happen <em>between</em>. Like growth, healing does not have a source or an origin, personal or impersonal. Continuity underlies all dynamics and processes of growth.</p>
<p>Mind negates absence, separation, and discontinuity. Where there is conflict, disconnection, or discontinuity in the fabric of one's perceptual matrix (the collection of all beliefs), there will be emotion and pain, drawing attention and awareness to the disconnection.</p>
<p>Individually and culturally, one should always move attention and awareness into those areas which have pain and need to be healed. Acute situations are the result of persistently ignoring a chronic problem.</p>
<p>The correction for obsession is not suppression, but extension. To focus on only one person or only one aspect of life — and to include nothing else — is a painful discontinuity: attention is uneven and in some places, absent. The lack of attention itself results in increased potentiality for painful surprises and experiences ("Everything is sudden to those who are blind").</p>
<p>Healing involves a letting go of form and a return to feeling. Connection and integration will always create new potentials and choices.</p>
<p>Manifestation is the movement of feeling into form. Attaching to a specific form of manifestation is to realize disappointment. In creation and manifestation, the resulting realized form will always be different than expected. Creation is cooperative and always involves more than self.</p>
<p>To remain attached to only one specific form and to discard or reject all others is to suffer an obsession, and in this way, discontinuity and pain; the distribution of acceptance and awareness is not equi-tempered<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-025'>[25]</a>. To let go of attachment to outer form allows for an acceptance of inner feeling (inner attachment). When the channels of feeling are opened, love can flow outward again and manifest as new and different forms.</p>
<p>The peak strength of the feelings and emotions aroused will be in proportion to both the acuteness of the conflict of one's commonly held ideas and beliefs and the degree of contextual importance with which those beliefs are involved in one's life.</p>
<p>The pattern, severity, and distribution of stress in the mind of self will define the pattern, severity, and distribution of conflict in one's life.</p>
<p>Difficulty in healing (the level of emotional intensity required) increases in proportion to the pervasiveness and fixedness of the involved ideologies, beliefs, ideas, and perceptions. The required subjective intensity, (and inversely, the probably of success of a healing) is proportional to the inertia associated with the structures of the mind needing to be changed. The greater the intensity (emotional force) and the lower the degree of fixation in the patterns of one's thoughts, the more effective the healing.</p>
<p>The more one's ideologies and beliefs are perceived 'Truths', the greater the degree of change in the state of consciousness — a change in the position of awareness — required to know them for certain as Actual Truths or to realize them as Beliefs deeply held.</p>
<p>The more that the perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies that one wants to change provide a common context for all of one's experiences in life, the greater the degree of abstractness, pervasiveness, and comprehensiveness of the efforts required to change them.</p>
<p>Where a blockage of emotion or a conflict of belief persists at a particular level of emotional intensity, the release of that blockage will require and involve a similar level of emotional intensity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-026'>[26]</a>.</p>
<p>The flexibility of mind increases, often suddenly, with increasing degrees of emotional intensity. All perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies, are changeable when there is sufficient intensity.</p>
<p>Healings which are infrequent, singular, and which are directed to ultimate causes are more effective than multiple efforts toward multiple symptoms. As with all growth, sufficient time and peacefulness must occur between significant changes to allow for real integration. Healings which are too frequent, or which attempt to change more than one basic condition at a time, can easily lead to complex interactions and unexpected side effects.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=25>
<li id='footnote-025'><p>For example, a depressed person must let go of the expected form of realization of their love in order to return to the essence and deep inner nature of that love.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-026'><p>For example, the intensity necessary within the process of healing a traumatic experience will often need to be of a similar magnitude as that of the traumatic event itself. The difference between effective healing and an event of further pain is the context of safety, sacredness, knowledge, and awareness. In these cases, healing involves a special environment designed to handle that intensity; a context as much as a content.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Changing Beliefs</h3>
<p>In many cases, healing involves changing feeling by the proxy of changing action, thought, association, assumptions, and belief.</p>
<p>To change a belief (a structure of mind), it is necessary to know, identify, and recognize the belief <em>as</em> a belief, and not as a 'necessary fact'. Belief recognition converts an unconscious assumption of truth, a limitation, into a conscious acceptance of an allowable choice, a freedom.</p>
<p>When changing beliefs and assumptions, gradual point by point replacement is better than sudden rejection. When changing a belief or assumption, a practice of nurturing addition, expansion, and integration will always be more effective than any practices based on dissolution, cessation, division, suppression, or analysis.</p>
<p>Beliefs cannot be changed in isolation. They must be managed in groups and clusters of related beliefs. This often involves examining the connections and interdependencies between related beliefs and assumptions.</p>
<p>When changing a belief, it is necessary to choose a replacement belief which provides something of the same benefits and 'payoff' as the original belief. All beliefs have a meaning and a cause. The design of the replacement belief must be connected to other (unchanged) beliefs and ideas. The new belief must 'fit', and provide something of the same or better 'function' within the structure of one's own consciousness.</p>
<p>Each belief must be adapted to the environment in which it lives (other beliefs, associations, and ideas). The best design of a new belief is one that nurtures or ensures an increase in potentials and wholeness of the self. For a new belief to be effectively accepted, it must be frequently triggered in one's current style of life.</p>
<p>Change and growth cannot be rushed. As with a fragile flower, the new belief needs the chance to grow with patient persistent nurturance and focus of attention and consciousness. In time, it will again become habitual, known, and unconscious. Without commitment, change cannot and will not occur within the self.</p>
<p>Success in changing one or more beliefs at any given depth is likely to affect many surface beliefs (i.e., any beliefs which are more in the mind than the one changed). Changing a fundamental belief will typically require coordinated adjustment of a large number of other beliefs which are supported by it.</p>
<p>To change a belief or assumption (pattern of the perceptual matrix of self), one is required to move/focus awareness at the depth of consciousness (level of abstraction) where the belief pattern is defined<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-027'>[27]</a>.</p>
<p>Where there is perception, there is also change. To position awareness at the same level of depth at which a belief is defined enables one to choose a change in position, habit and/or coordination of the choices which compose that belief.</p>
<p>The greater the change in the state of one's consciousness, the greater the amount of emotional energy (passion, love, desire) involved. Some changes (effects of choice) will always be more difficult, and will involve more effort and energy to make than others.</p>
<p>Difficulty in changing a belief is directly proportional to the span of the contextual scope with which that belief applies to expressions, events, and experiences in one's life. Beliefs at greater depths, in the soul, will require more effort to change and are more likely to remain stable than beliefs in the mind.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=27>
<li id='footnote-027'><p>Accessing deeper levels may be more difficult and require more energy, more concentrated and coordinated effort, and greater coherency.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Society and Emotion</h3>
<p>Highly emotional events are those which involve the greatest values and desires; those which are believed to be of importance and significance. This is especially apparent when aspects of self are blocked, confused, and conflicted (where there is separation and discontinuity).</p>
<p>Perceptions cluster into ideas. Ideas combine into beliefs. Systems of belief become ideologies. On an individual and societal level, emotions are found most often where ideologies, beliefs, ideas, and perceptions conflict.</p>
<p>The degree to which emotion is apparent is in proportion to the degree of blockage, resistance, or de-coherence involved in value, significance, and purpose. The scale of emotion will match the scale at which these compositions are apparently in conflict<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-028'>[28]</a>.</p>
<p>Where there is strong fear, anger or frustration, one may also find great love, passion, and strength.</p>
<p>It is as great a desire of self to grow as it is for a culture to evolve. Growth happens in interaction, connection, and coherency; the continuity of being. As such, both selves and societies always seek to find resolution between conflicting perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies.</p>
<p>Only that which nurtures life will continue to live.</p>
<p>Only when there is clarity and purity of mind, wholesomeness of life and self, does the gradual release of inhibition encourage joy.</p>
<p>To enable, allow, and nurture one's desires with clarity, precision, and purity is to realize love in life with health, wealth, and joy. In proportion to its purity, desire (Love) always connects, enlivens, and nurtures.</p>
<p>Ultimately, desires are never necessarily in conflict. At the root, the desires of self and those of culture are always in deep alignment and agreement. The deepest desires of the self are always connected with the deepest desires of the community.</p>
<p>Only the perceptions, expressions, representations, and beliefs about desire can be in conflict; root desires are never themselves in conflict. Only forms (how one thinks about and expresses one's desires) can be in conflict; feelings are always consonant (never in conflict).</p>
<p>It is in the action of inhibition, suppression, restriction, and cessation, a blockage of love, emotion, desire, feeling, attachment, significance, connectedness, and life, that one knows, and others will feel, pain and suffering. To reduce the pain and suffering caused by a conflict (a disconnection between various ideologies and beliefs), it is necessary to heal the connection; to integrate these ideologies and beliefs by recognizing, honoring, and enlivening each of them. Hold as sacred the root desires which give each ideology its basis and strength.</p>
<p>Peace is the result of nurturing and integrating the life of all beliefs. Any attempt to suppress, restrict, or inhibit love, ideals, beliefs and ideologies will cause pain and suffering, both for oneself and for all others that one touches.</p>
<p>Different emotions are different levels of the self. All levels of self, self-thinking, and self-feeling, must be known, acknowledged, and accepted to make effective choices.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> refers to the ability to <u>choose</u> and respond, rather than just the ability to <u>function</u>.</p>
<p>The best form of health is always found in interdependence. All of nature lives in interdependence; never dependence or independence<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-029'>[29]</a>.</p>
<p>The most effective choice will always be the one made from a basis which is the most enabling of all other choices.</p>
<p>In that the deeper emotions are the more affecting ones, they are also the most enabling ones.<br />
Ultimately, love is more enabling of choice than any other emotion<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-030'>[30]</a>.</p>
<p>Choices made on the basis of love are healthier, more nurturing, and more effective. Always choose from the basis of love. Always choose with an immediate awareness and consciousness of the manner in which the deepest essence of love and desire is reflected and connected to that choice.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=28>
<li id='footnote-028'><p>Where the great tectonic plates collide, the earth shakes and quakes and rises up into volcanoes. Similarly, the greatest upwellings of emotion occur most frequently in those places where and when great ideologies collide.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-029'><p>Total independence is eventually realized to be equivalent to total isolation; it is a totality of being cut off and disconnected from the world.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-030'><p>Choice made on the basis of any other emotion is less effective. Although making choice on the basis of anger may appear to be more satisfying in the short-term, such a choice is in the long-term far less effective at realizing anything truly significant. For example, choice made on the basis of skepticism or fear always results in insignificance; it is ultimately impractical.</p></li>

<h2>Aphorisms of Action</h2>
<h3>Ethics and Morality</h3>
<p><strong>Ethics:</strong> organized thought concerned with the study of, and adherence to, the principles of effective choice. Ethics is internal to oneself and independent of any particular domain.</p>
<p><strong>Morality:</strong> an externally defined set of rules in a particular domain, generally applicable to all selves; and the degree that the choices of self adhere to those rules. Morality is the application of a collection of statements or codes which hopefully represent the principles of ethics in terms appropriate for a specific domain or world.</p>
<p>The relationship between ethics and morals is similar to the relationship between philosophy (metaphysics) and science (physics). Ethics is always the ultimate basis for any moral, statutory, or civil code in much the same way that metaphysics is always the ultimate basis for any physics.</p>
<p>Ethics is the study of the principles of the most effective means of self-expression, in both words and actions. It is about how to make one's choices more effective, for all of oneself and for all others in both form and feeling.</p>
<p>A statement of ethics is a statement of principle<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-031'>[31]</a>. It originates from and has its basis within self.</p>
<p>A statement of morals is a statement of statutory or civil law. A statement of morality originates from and has its basis within a specific world, domain, or culture. It is a command or directive to be followed by all selves in that world.</p>
<p>Each "action" is a form of communication between self and world; it involves aspects of both perception and expression. In this sense, ethics is the study of 'the best way to communicate'.</p>
<p>In connection with the nature of effective choice, the principles of effective expression and communication (all of which are involved in any real practice of ethics) are ultimately defined in terms of the attainment of the basal motivations.</p>
<p>To consider how to increase the effectiveness of one's choices is to determine what is meant by simultaneously preserving the integrity and increasing the potentiality of both life and evolution. To maximize potentiality and integrity is to maximize the combination of symmetry and continuity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-032'>[32]</a> in the relationships between self (the subjective) and reality (the objective).</p>
<p>To develop the principles of ethics is to determine a method and, therefore, a practice of making maximally effective choices. An effective set of ethical principles will positively specify<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-033'>[33]</a> and characterize effective choices.</p>
<p>Ethics focuses simultaneously on the value, meaning, and purpose of expressions (choices and events), with an emphasis on meaningfulness. In ethics there is no right or wrong<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-034'>[34]</a>, there are only varying degrees of effectiveness, of enhancement of life and evolution, and other capacity to nurture (mindful) consciousness.</p>
<p>The absolute <em>principles</em> of ethics are common to all of consciousness (all individuals).<br />
The absolute <em>practice</em> of ethics is particular and unique to each individual; it cannot be prescribed from without.</p>
<p>Ethics is always implemented relative to the self and to the situation.<br />
The realization of ethics is unique in each choice.</p>
<p>While there are only two principles (essential statements) of non-relativistic ethics, there are many effective ways to enact them. There are many ways to live ethically. While there can be any number of moral codes, it is usually considered that there is only one 'right way' to enact them; it is believed that there is only one way to live morally.</p>
<p>Ethic principles (laws) are natural, and cannot be enforced.<br />
Moral codes (rules/laws) are civil, and can only be enforced.</p>
<p>To require others to be 'ethical', or to label them as being 'unethical', is itself inherently unethical. One cannot enforce ethics (ethical action and choice) on any other, in any world, ever. It is impossible. Only by being ethical can one encourage, allow, and enable others to also be ethical.</p>
<p>One can only act effectively and ethically as oneself (personally). One can never act on behalf of, or in the place of another, any other, ever. This includes acting on behalf of causality or 'the universe', or 'in the name of God'. One's own subjectivity can never replace or supplant the objectivity of any world.</p>
<p>Any effort which attempts to make life adhere strictly, ultimately, and absolutely, to any moral code without any exceptions, no matter how minor, will eventually kill it. Such life will lose all meaningfulness and value. To apply a moral code with absolute aspects or in an absolute manner is to ensure that the value of and meaning of the moral code itself will ultimately be lost.</p>
<p>Life and evolution depend (in part) on occasional exceptions.<br />
No single set of rules, no matter what their origin<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-035'>[35]</a>, can encompass life.</p>
<p>No world is 'fair', nor can any world be expected to be fair, even though all worlds are in their own way beautiful.<br />
Life itself is dynamic, inherently involving inequality in evolution and change, a flux across a boundary.<br />
Life is ultimately ethical, yet it is not moral.</p>
<p>To be meaningful, life will involve some degree of rhythm and change;<br />
a dynamic which eventually exceeds and extends beyond all fixed boundaries.</p>
<p>One chooses most effectively when choosing (and continuing to choose) from one's deepest basis of desire (love). The best choices express that desire in a manner which is affirming to all of life at all levels of being, in all worlds<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-036'>[36]</a>.</p>
<p>Choices and actions are most effective when they are the most ethical;<br />
when they preserve both symmetry <strong>and</strong> continuity.</p>
<p>Will has the nature of form and the being of attention to exist as one cause.<br />
Love has the nature of feeling and the being of intention to create many choices.</p>
<p>Any fully expressed choice which totally encompasses the subjective will also totally encompass the objective. Any choice which is truly and ultimately supportive and nurturing of <em>all</em> aspects of one's being will also have consequences which are supportive of <em>all</em> other beings<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-037'>[37]</a>.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=31>
<li id='footnote-031'><p>The study of ethics is ultimately about identifying and applying the principles of effective choice. It is not about whether any given choice is 'right' or 'wrong' in some absolute sense. Only morality can be considered in such a thoughtless and disabling manner.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-032'><p>To maximize the degree of continuity and the degree of symmetry is <i>not</i> to assert that symmetry and continuity will be realized in exactly the same manner for the same thing at teh same time. Rather, symmetry and continuity are to be considered as applying to difference <u>aspects</u> of one common dynamic, the relationship/communication between the subjective (self) and teh objective (world). The principles of ethics will, therefore, describe what would be required in this common dynamic (communication) for the subjective and the objective to be realized (made real and known) <b>as</b> objective and subjective.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-033'><p>To assert "positive specification" is to have an ethics which describes what or how to choose — which choices are best — rather than stating only what not to choose (which choices are worst, to be avoided). All negatively defined ethical systems must be regarded as incomplete.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-034'><p>This is in contract with a system of morality, which is defined as a fixed set of rules concerning what is right and what is wrong. Morality is usually defined in terms of goodness and virtue. Regardless of the degree to which a philosophy, religion, or society may confuse ethical concerns with moral ones, ethics <i>cannot</i> be considered as having externally fixed rules of right or wrong.</p><p>To the extent that a moral code defines some things as "good" (valued, of virtue) and others as "bad" (some actions as right and others as wrong), there exists the risk of being inherently unethical in proportion to the degree that the boundary between the good and the bad is 'sharp' (an expression of discontinuity). Systems of morality which are defined in 'black and white' terms are fundamentally antithetical to life and consciousness and are to be avoided.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-035'><p>This includes all sources, personal and impersonal; mundane and divine.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-036'><p>This principle of effective choice continues to apply regardless of the level of intensity involved in that choice. In making choices of high intensity, a corresponding level/degree of integrity in representing that desire and affirming life is required</p></li>
<li id='footnote-037'><p>It is important that this principle be applied with near absolute perfection. Under such circumstances, it is guaranteed to work.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Judgment and Justice</h3>
<p>Where the degree of intensity in interaction is very high, one is required to act with a very high level of integrity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-038'>[38]</a> (very ethically).</p>
<p>One is permitted, empowered, and required to respond to an action affecting oneself (to act on) with a similar level of intensity as the degree to which one has been acted upon (neither much more nor much less)<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-039'>[39]</a>.</p>
<p>In all interchange, there is to be maintained continuity. Where one has been deeply affected, that one may effect deeply; not to diminish or to escalate, but to change. Such changes are best and most effectively realized when enabling the realization of the deepest dreams of all involved.</p>
<p>To sustain the integrity of self, be conscious of an choose the level of intensity of interaction with a world.<br />
Be sure to choose the time of the best usage of intensity and of one's own involvement with it.</p>
<p>One can only make one's own choices. One can only accept what is in one's own experience.</p>
<p><strong>Judgment</strong> refers to an evaluation of a choice (act or expression) made by someone other than oneself.<br />
Judgment <em>also</em> refers to an attempt to make choices in place of (or on behalf of) someone other than oneself.</p>
<p><strong>Justice:</strong> When a self <em>external</em> to an event of subjective action (choice) attempts to deliberately implement on that subjectivity a 'moral' causality. A personal action of 'justice' is <em>believed</em> to be necessary when there is <em>also</em> the belief that no other natural causal relation would impersonally be applied.</p>
<p>Any attempt to seek justice is to hold the false expectation that the impersonal natural world would or should adhere to one's own arbitrary personal sense of right. As such, justice can only be regarded as a moral concern and cannot be regarded as an ethical one<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-040'>[40]</a>.</p>
<p>To implement 'justice' is an attempt to personally act 'on behalf of', or 'in place of', natural causality<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-041'>[41]</a>. Ultimately, this must be understood as <u>a lack of faith</u> in deity, the universe, and/or the causality of the world in which one operates.</p>
<p>To consider if an act or choice was just or unjust, to sit in judgment, is to attempt to evaluate choices (actions) which are not one's own. The essence of the meaning of judgment requires an objective consideration of that which is basically subjective (a choice or an act of expression). However, the objective cannot ever perceive the subjective. Therefore, the attempt to personally consider or judge another's choice is inherently and fundamentally impossible. To enact judgment is to act ineffectively and by definition, unethically. Regardless of appearance, a judgment is always one's own choice.</p>
<p>Because the essence of objective judgment involves choices which are external to oneself, the practice of judgment is inherently unethical. Implementing justice requires one to make choices on behalf of something that is not self, and thus involves choices which are not one's own. Attempting to implement justice is inherently unethical. There can be no ethical justice and no ethical judgments in a personal, objective, and effective sense.</p>
<p>The practice and implementation of ethics involves personal choice; it is never concerned with either justice or judgment.</p>
<p>In that the ends to not justify the means, neither do the means justify, determine, fix, or ultimately define the ends<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-042'>[42]</a>. There is always more than one path, more than one way to accomplish something; and there is always more than one thing accomplished.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the consequences of one's action always return to the point from which intent originates. In matters of crime and guilt, it is the act itself which is its own worst punishment. No one can hide from the consequences of their choices<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-043'>[43]</a>.</p>
<p>All choices, expressions, and methods of understanding involve ethical implications. No perception, knowledge, or experience of the self will have ethical implications. No events of change or of causality have ethical implications.</p>
<p>Ultimately, one can only account for, or be asked to account for, one's own choices and expressions. Furthermore, this accounting can only 1) occur in the domains/worlds in which those choices/expressions have their beingness and consequence, and 2) include those aspects of the choice which had a logical or reasonable basis. One must always (and can only) be responsible for the totality of their choices and expressions, neither more nor less.</p>
<p>One cannot be legitimately required to account for one's perceptions<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-044'>[44]</a> or knowing in any domain, world, or universe. Expression is always public; perception is always private.</p>
<p>The knowledge of something in itself carries no ethical assignment.<br />
The expression of an understanding will always have (must have, cannot not have) an ethical aspect.</p>
<p>Having knowledge in itself, is ultimately independent of ethics.<br />
Knowledge can never be objectively judged by another; it may be subjectively judged only by oneself.<br />
However, the choice to express or not express in accordance with that knowledge may have ethical implications.</p>
<p>One is always responsible for all aspects of their expression and choices at the exact moment of their choice, neither before nor after.</p>
<p>To the extent (neither more nor less) that the <em>same</em> conscious being can continue to make choice, they <u>continue</u> to be responsible.</p>
<p>One cannot ever be responsible for the choices of another.<br />
One cannot be held responsible for the reactions or responses of others.<br />
One can be held responsible only for their own actions and responses.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=38>
<li id='footnote-038'><p>Integrity has the meaning of 'to act as one together'. It connotates wholeness, health, and a complete unity of being.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-039'><p>The key to this principle is to act in a manner that is perfectly transformative, rather than in a manner which is merely reactionary.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-040'><p>Only in thinking of 'justice' as a personal practice of maintaining a continuity of intensity of interaction (to 'make just' or 'to regulate'), can this concept be regarded as having ethical implication. However, by itself this is not a complete embodiment of ethics, for a continuity of intensity does not fully describe what would be required for effective, and therefore ethical, choice.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-041'><p>For example: To claim that one is judging and enacting justice (or vengeance) 'in the name of God' is to imply that God would not otherwise choose, support, or intervene/act in agreement with the chosen moral code (a religious or civil law). Any activity (for example, the 'righteous' condemnation of others) that is 'justified' on the basis of religious convictions is ultimately founded on the <i>absence</i> of religious conviction. All 'religious wars' are categorically <u>not</u> based on having religion; they are due to an absence of religion.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-042'><p>For example, favorable intentions alone are not sufficient to create a favorable outcome.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-043'><p>This is a direct consequence of the definition of self. Refer to page 8.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-044'><p>The concept of perception is distinct from the concepts of knowledge, understanding, and choice. However, to the extent that perception <u>becomes</u> knowledge, and to the extent that knowledge <u>becomes</u> understanding, and to the extend that understanding changes choice, and to the extent that choice must have ethical and moral implications, so also may perception be considered to have indirect moral and ethical implications (neither more nor less than the exact product of these degrees).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Action, Reaction, Response</h3>
<p>Action, reaction, and response are distinct, yet inseparable. There is never a response that does not have some aspect of action and reaction. There is never an action or reaction that does not have some aspect of response.</p>
<p>The ultimate realization of Action is always going to be Change. The ultimate realization of Reaction is always going to be Causality. The ultimate realization of Response is always going to be Choice.</p>
<p>The <strong>React/Response Ratio:</strong> A measure of the degree of effort invested relative to the degree of consequence resulting from that effort. It is the ratio of the degree to which something has an affective nature, a potentiality to create change, as considered in relation to the degree to which there results in effective outcome, the actuality of change. It refers to the specific degree of apparent amplification (increase) or attenuation (diminishment) in the energy relationship between self and world. It is the ratio between action (choice) and reaction (causality).</p>
<p><strong>Affect:</strong> The degree of choice or effort (influence or personal/subjective energy invested) in the expressions of the self.</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The degree of outcome, consequence, or impact of a self expression.</p>
<p>Where the react/response ratio is zero (all effort and no result) there is only unconsciousness (total insensitivity). Where the react/response ratio is infinite (all reaction and no response), there is only prejudice (pre-judgment, also a form of unconsciousness). Consciousness can only be maintained when the ratios of action, reaction, and response are near one-to-one.</p>
<p>To be <strong>responsible</strong> as the being of oneself, one must choose and respond (act), rather than to react and reject (to be in false judgment). To be responsible is to sit in consciousness rather than merely in conscience.</p>
<p>Ethics (continuity) is best realized when the react/response ratio is near to unity (1 to 1). The greatest levels of effectiveness are attained when there is a balance between affect and effect<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-045'>[45]</a>. The maximum effectiveness (world health) is obtained when the wisdom with which one chooses is equal to the degree of consequence associated with that choice.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=45>
<li id='footnote-045'><p>With regard to self and world, a strong dynamic balance between affect and effect is the ideal. The degree to which this ideal holds is in proportion to the proximity and intensity of the interaction between self and world. To have consistently and significantly more affect than effect is to experience frustration and pain. To have significantly more effect than affect is to be tyrannical, to experience paranoia, and/or to inflict pain.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Wisdom and Maturity</h3>
<p>Feelings, although they cannot be long held, are kept within the self.<br />
Forms although they can be held long, cannot be kept within the world.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is the flow and transformation of outer worldly forms into the inward feelings of self.<br />
<strong>Expression</strong> is the transformation and flow of inward self feelings into outward worldly forms.</p>
<p>Expression always involves an addition of information, pattern, or structure.<br />
Perception always involves a removal of information, pattern, or structure.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong> refers to that which selects, filters, and transforms perception.<br />
<strong>Understanding</strong> is that which constructs, and is the basis of, all expression.<br />
<strong>Wisdom</strong> is the integration and synthesis of both knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>With increasing subjective time,<br />
knowing increases when moving gradually from the macroscopic toward the microscopic, and<br />
understanding increases when moving gradually form the microscopic toward the macroscopic.</p>
<p>For one's life to be meaningful and significant,<br />
the feeling within self must become forms in the world, and<br />
the forms of within the world must become feelings in the self.</p>
<p>The degree of <strong>maturity</strong> of an individual is proportional to their responsibility<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-046'>[46]</a>, their wisdom, and the degree to which these are used <em>together</em> in their actions and choices.</p>
<p>The absolute degree of <strong>maturity</strong> is the multiplicative product of:</p>
<ol>
<li>the degree of responsibility with</li>
<li>the relative degree of wisdom with</li>
<li>the degree that one's choices of responsibility are made in accordance with that wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maturity is in proportion to the quantity, quality, and significance of the choices made. A mature individual is someone who chooses with effectiveness for all concerned at all levels of being.</p>
<p>The rule of a nation is most effective when the maturity of the leadership is equal to the scope of that leadership. Never should the scope of a leadership exceed its degree of maturity. A leader of millions of lives needs to have the maturity of millions of lives.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=46>
<li id='footnote-046'><p>The degree of responsibility is proportional to the scope, span, and frequency of choice.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Politics</h3>
<p><strong>Politics</strong> is what happens when a group of people make decisions based upon what they fear, rather than on what they love.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong> is what happens when people in a group make decisions on the basis of what they love, what they all commonly desire together.</p>
<p>The process of communication is best facilitated when each participant freely, honestly, and fully grants to the other these three rights:<br />
<em>1) the right to speak, 2) the right to be understood, and 3) the right to know that one has been understood.</em><br />
Communication between people does not happen unless and until all three of these rights have been (at least implicitly) granted from each to the other.<br />
These rights of communication cannot be taken; they can only be given.</p>
<p>As long as any one person or country chooses on the basis of fear there will be strife, frustration, and pain. It is only in consensus and desire that agreement and true peace are reached.</p>
<p>The emotional energy associated with political debates is proportional to the intensity of the perception of <u>a lack of value</u> for something that is regarded as personally important.</p>
<p>Primary value systems among people tend to have three major organizations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Values of objectivity and understanding: ultimately values of <em>wisdom and intelligence</em>.<br />
Examples include: science, technology, western materialism and capitalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values of the hereafter and otherworldly; ultimately values of <em>mysticism and spirituality</em>.<br />
Examples include: Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, and other organized/institutionalized religions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values of life, the here and now, and living in the present; ultimate values of <em>nature and community</em>.<br />
Examples include: environmentalism, the hippy movement, Gaia or Earth consciousness, paganism and tribalism.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All three values are needed and are mutually supporting and affirming.<br />
Holding any one value over the other two results in imbalance and suffering.<br />
Maximum effectiveness occurs when there is a true balance among these three primary value systems.</p>
<p>All three values are required for continued life. Any person or culture which lacks any of these is incomplete (not whole, unhealthy), and survives only because of the forbearance of others.</p>
<p>To effect positive change is to 1) help all others (everyone) to know their real desires, and 2) to cooperatively help discover the most effective method for their realization. To make positive change is to help everyone act on the basis of what is wanted, (or needed, or desired) so as to get what is wanted/needed/desired, rather than on the basis of what is <u>not</u> wanted or feared.</p>
<p>Optimum methods of group decision making help people to know what they love, what they really care about, and enable them to choose on that basis<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-047'>[47]</a>. The solution to unproductive political debate is to practice <em>all</em> values with unconditional acceptance.</p>
<p>Only in combination may one's actions be both meaningful and effective.<br />
To realize truth and honor in life one needs to be gentle and firm,<br />
to have both compassion and ruthlessness, and be able to act with both sensitivity and severity.<br />
These aspects cannot occur singly; they <strong>must</strong> always occur together<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-048'>[48]</a>.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=47>
<li id='footnote-047'><p>Examples: One cannot stop war by hating and fearing war. One can only stop war by desiring peace, choosing on the basis of peace, and helping others to acknowledge and choose on the basis of their own desires for peace and fulfillment too. To sustain the environment, the natural world, it is essential to enable others to get in touch with how much they care about the environment. Knowing how to love one's own children in a natural manner enables other people to love their children more naturally.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-048'><p>
<p>Example: In part, the ultimate warrior (in the idealistic martial arts sense) must be at once completely sensitive, aware, and accepting or all that occurs, without judgment or conditioning. In addition, the ultimate warrior must be able to completely and wholly commit decisively, with total faith and confidence, to their chosen action without reservation or hesitation in any part of self. The perception and compassion of the warrior is infinitely gentle and subtle while the expression of the warrior (their action) is confident, skillful, and absolutely firm.</p>
<p>With total openness and sensitivity, the effective warrior perceives directly; thus gaining true knowledge about others and the world. Anything less, in the form of judgment, distortion or a filtering and conditioning of perception, will result in significant weakness and ineffectiveness. The strength of the warrior is in the perfection of their sensitivity.</p>
<p>With complete and decisive commitment to do what needs to be done (ruthlessness), the warrior acts with a wholeness of being, effecting maximum effectiveness. To act only in part, without coordination among all aspects of self, is to diminish significance. Maximum meaning and effectiveness is attained only when all aspects of self act in coordinated concert together. The strength of the warrior is in the perfection of their integrity of action.</p>
<p>Only where all of these attributes occur together and at once is the maximum of life realized.</p>
</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Truth</h3>
<p>Truth is reality, self, and the interchange between them. Truth is both relative and absolute.</p>
<p>Truth is more than "that which one can consider" (perceive) with total confidence, clarity, and certainty.<br />
<strong>Truth</strong> is that with which one can personally <u>act</u> with total confidence and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Truth is not so much about correctness in thinking as it is about the significance and efficiency of choice.<br />
It is not so much about perceptual certainty as it is about expression with clarity, effectiveness, and confidence<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-049'>[49]</a>.</p>
<p>The basis for consideration of a truth is not only in the value that it actually has in clarifying thought, or even in the purposes to which it can potentially be applied. It is also in the significance and meaningfulness that it give to life. The meaning of a truth is always more basica than its value or its purpose.</p>
<p>No one is ever wholly wrong; there is always a grain of truth in whatever anyone says, or is in their being.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing only on what is false, or who or what is at fault, wisdom involves focusing on whatever is true, whole (wholesome), valid, and right.</p>
<p>One knows truth as much through the process of feeling as through the process of thought.</p>
<p>Recognition of a deep truth requires that one place as full a reliance on personal, subjective, and unreasoned feeling (personal validation and intuition) as on impersonal, objective and reasoned form (facts and proofs).</p>
<p>It is only when both feeling and thinking are used together that one may know Truth.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=49>
<li id='footnote-049'><p>True clarity implies transparency, which hides nothing. Like honesty, it is understood to mean 'without hidden agenda or deceit'.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Faith</h3>
<p>All of choice is uncertain; one can never know all the consequences resulting from one's least action.<br />
Reason can provide only a partial basis for effective (ethical) choice.<br />
It is also necessary to make a careful, deep, and honest evaluation of the totality of one's feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> The use of a fullness and completeness (accuracy) of <em>thinking</em> as the primary basis of one's choices.</p>
<p><strong>Faith:</strong> The use of a fullness and completeness (precision) of <em>feeling</em> as the primary basis of one's choices.</p>
<p>When one is whole, healthy, knows fully and with clarity, and accepts unreservedly the totality of one's feelings and thoughts on all levels of being, the choices one makes in accordance with those feelings and thoughts will be at once wholly ethical and wholly effective.</p>
<p>Both thought and feeling, truth and faith, are to be applied together in fullness to attain efficient, effective ethical choices that are consistent with one's personal Path of Right Action.</p>
<p>No effective choice can be made only the basis of reason or faith. All natural choices involve some elements of reason and some elements of faith. These work best when used in an intimate mixture with one another, especially <em>after</em> validating that each can stand completely on its own <u>without</u> the other.</p>
<p>To have faith in a world (universe) is to have wisdom, knowledge, peacefulness, and insight.<br />
To have faith in oneself is to have security, skill, creativity, and playfulness.</p>
<p>To have faith is not to have certainty; it is to allow Trust.<br />
Faith and reason are not in opposition; they are mutually reflective, complementary aspects of a deeper whole.</p>
<p>Faith has no reason of its own; yet all reason implies faith.<br />
Reason has no faith of its own; yet all faith implies reason.</p>
<p>Faith cannot be constructed or possessed. Faith is not a commodity.<br />
Faith, never finite or constrained, is necessary to all commerce and creativity.<br />
Faith contributes to confidence and is involved in all practicality, reason, and construction.</p>
<p>Faith is not blind; it is <em>vision wide open</em>. Faith is an <u>acceptance</u> of potentiality and creativity, rather than an ignorance of reality and actuality. To have faith is to embrace the mythic, rather than to be rejecting the factual.</p>
<h3>The Path of Right Action</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is always possible to choose in a manner that is win-win for all involved, <u>including</u> oneself, at all levels of being (for all scales and aspects of consciousness from the smallest to the ultimate). It is always worthwhile to search for the best possible choice. There is never a circumstance in which it is not possible to choose in a win-win manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A win-win choice applied to one situation is adjacent to the win-win choice for each succeeding situation. Choosing the best choice always enables one to continue to choose well. Win-win choices are mutually self-supporting. As such, optimal choices are contiguous with one another, forming the <em>path</em> of right action. The "path" is the perfect possible sequence of one's own personal and unique choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degree to which it seems that one cannot make choices to that maximal benefit of all involved, including oneself, at all levels of being, is the measure of one's deviation from the path of right action. In circumstances where it <em>seems</em> that a situation requires a win-lose choice, the selection of the best choice for all involved will be the one leading in the direction of the path of right action, allowing eventual convergence with one's own, personal, absolute path.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The path of right action</em> is a realization of the self-supporting dynamics of effective choice. Once on this path, one lives in a dynamic balance: participating, creating, and experiencing; one acts with a clarity which is both internal and external.</p>
<p>A total continuity of the subjective always parallels a total symmetry of the objective. To enact choice with a total alignment and agreement of feeling, in all aspects and on all levels of self, is to create an outcome which is in alignment and agreement with, and beneficial to, all forms and beings (life) in the world.</p>
<p>With clarity one can act with a totality of clear conscience, without guilt or any internal hindrance (fears) of any kind. Within the discipline of the path (a seeming limitation), a true freedom of life is found.</p>
<p>One cannot determine, take away, or make choices for another. One must (and can only) make their own choices. No other can make choices for oneself, or take one's choices completely away. Others may be able to influence one's choices; however, they cannot determine them.</p>
<p>There is no one single right path of action for all individuals. There is only the unique right path for oneself.</p>
<p>One cannot perceive, walk, or determine, what the path of right action is for another, or on behalf of another.<br />
One can only attempt to perceive and walk (choose) one's own path of right action through life.</p>
<p>Confusing one's own path with that of any others will result in misunderstanding, dis-ease, illusion, disillusion, conflict, and pain. A clear knowledge and continued practice of one's own path results in understanding, ease of life, creativity, synchronicity, and joy. To practice one's path is to be in an alignment with all of life.</p>
<h3>Impeccability</h3>
<p>Impeccability is the perfection of ethics. It involves a completeness of interaction at all levels of being. The more one acts ethically, the more one is required to act ethically, and the easier and more natural the pattern of one's life.</p>
<p>An action of self is ethical to the degree that it increases the symmetry and continuity of self, world, and the relation between them. To act in accordance with ethics is an affirmation of the integrity of self and the significance of others. Ethical impeccability is a practice that knows sacredness by enacting sacredness.</p>
<p>One's choices are maximally affirming and sacred when they involve all aspects of self and have continuity and connection to others (the world). Choice is effective to the degree that it involves <em>both</em> a significant reflection on the meaning(s) of one's prior experience(s) <em>and</em> a significant investment of new meaningfulness (a significance which is reflective of the highest dreams of all concerned).</p>
<p>The action of <strong>labeling</strong> something or someone is problematic to the exact degree that it encourages a tendency to focus on only one aspect of that which is labeled, rather than on the whole. To use a <strong>name</strong> in a manner which accepts and honors the whole is valid.</p>
<p>Whenever there is an asymmetry of value, a break or discontinuity between those parts of a whole which are valued and those which are not, there is an associated experience of pain.</p>
<p><strong>Prejudice</strong> is a maintained discontinuity in the distribution of one's choices.<br />
It is an attempt to make choices beyond the boundary of self, as if to make choices for someone else.<br />
Prejudice is the choice to never choose again; to be forever insensitive to all experience, thought, and feeling.<br />
<em>Prejudice reflects a discontinuity in one's awareness of <u>change</u> and interchange.</em></p>
<p><strong>Selfishness</strong> is the failure to recognize and accommodate the needs of another when it could be done at little or no cost to oneself. It is both an ignorance of the possible benefits one's choices may have for another, and an unwillingness to correct that ignorance. Selfishness reflects the loss of insight for a win-win result for all involved.<br />
<em>Selfishness reflects a discontinuity in one's awareness of <u>choice</u> and potentiality.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cruelty</strong> refers to an act that reflects an absence of sensitivity for any one or any part of those who would be affects by those acts. One acts with cruelty when one has an absence of, or presumes to have an absence of, sensitivity to interaction and consciousness on the part of any other.<br />
<em>Cruelty reflects a discontinuity in one's awareness of actuality, <u>cause</u>, and consequence.</em></p>
<p>To act with <strong>grace</strong> is to act with a distribution of awareness and sensitivity which matches the effects and consequences of one's actions and choices. When making choices, one must remain sensitive and aware of that which is not oneself (the shared significance of other people and the world), as much as one is aware of one's own needs, wants, and desires.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Being</h2>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Essence is not defined by an ultimate conclusion, symbology, or ultimate form;<br />
it is known by its significance in the present.</p>
<p>In essence, the dynamic of communication is the same dynamic as that which occurs between self and reality. Ultimately, languages are domains and domains are languages. By understanding the inherent dynamics of all communication, one can better understand the metaphysics of creation, interaction, and existence ('the Universe'), the dynamics of choice, change, and causality.</p>
<p>Information begins and ends in objectivity. Communication begins and ends in subjectivity. Information is defined in terms of form, quantity, discontinuity, and symmetry. Communication is defined in terms of feeling, quality, asymmetry, and continuity.</p>
<p>The content of communication is form (in<em>form</em>ation). As such, the greater the degree that something is subjective, the larger the number of transformations required to express it (i.e., as necessary to convert/transform feeling into form). Perception (existence), unto itself, is always complete. Expression (creation) is always incomplete.</p>
<p><em>First Parallel Aspect:</em> The degree to which communication is literal and has the power (purpose) to convince and persuade, is proportional to the degree that it involves a transition in scale from the microscopic (detail) toward the mesoscopic within only one domain of representation.</p>
<p>The greater the degree that the content of communication involves a movement of one's awareness from small details back toward the natural ranges (scale) of one's life, the more the communication has expressive power, can be interpreted literally, and will persuade one of its truth.</p>
<p><em>Second Parallel Aspect:</em> The degree to which communication (vision and intuition) is symbolic and has strength, value, significance, and insight (nurtures motivation), is proportional to the degree that it involves a transition in scale from the macroscopic (overview) toward the mesoscopic within many domains of representation.</p>
<p>The greater the degree that the content of communication involves a movement of one's awareness from a wide-ranging overview back toward the natural ranges of one's life, the more that the communication has perceptive strength, must be interpreted figuratively, and has greater insight, significance, and meaningfulness (mythic value).</p>
<h3>Meaning, Purpose, and Value</h3>
<p>Meaning, purpose, and value are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.<br />
To truly have any one of these, all three must be present.</p>
<p>One's sense of meaning refers to the <u>emotion</u> (energy) of the subjective context of choice.<br />
One's sense of purpose refers to the <u>form</u> of the subjective context of choice.<br />
One's sense of value refers to the <u>feeling</u> of the subjective context of choice.</p>
<p><em>Within Self (within the subjective):</em><br />
Purpose is a measure of that which is internal to the boundary of self.<br />
Value is a measure of that which is external to the boundary of self.<br />
Meaning is a measure of that which crosses the boundary of self.</p>
<p><em>Within World (within the objective):</em><br />
Purpose is a measure of the external potentiality of a thing (its degree of perceived utility for oneself).<br />
Value is a measure of the internal potentiality of a thing (its perceived utility for others).<br />
Meaning is a measure of the potentiality between things.</p>
<p>Meaningfulness and significance is the synthesis of both value and purpose. The degree to which an eventity is meaningful is proportional to the multiplicative product of the degree that the eventity has value and the degree that it has purpose.</p>
<p>Everything has significance. There is never an absence of significance. Every perception and expression has some degree of meaningfulness. In significance, all perceptions and expressions have some degree of purposefulness and value.</p>
<p>There is no single purpose or any single value for all of life, all of consciousness, all of beingness, in any world or domain. The purpose, value, and significance of each life, consciousness, and being, is always plural. No eventity or domain is ever without—or ever has just one—purpose, value, or meaning.</p>
<p>Perception, experience, and causality are considered in terms of value.<br />
Expression, creativity, and choice are considered in terms of purpose.<br />
There is no expression that is without purpose. There is no perception or experience that is without value.<br />
All experiences have equal value. All expressions have unequal purpose.</p>
<p>Value is always described, from the inside toward the outside.<br />
Purpose is always prescribed, from the outside toward the inside.</p>
<p>The nature of purpose is from top to bottom, largest to smallest, and from without to within.<br />
The nature of value is from bottom to top, smallest to largest, and from within to without.</p>
<p>Potentialities always have value. Actualities always have purpose.<br />
The degree of value associated with an eventity is proportional to the degree that the eventity has potentiality.<br />
The degree of purpose associated with an eventity is proportional to the degree that the eventity has actuality.</p>
<p>The value of a tool increases with the subjective assessment of the potential uses to which the tool could be applied. The purpose of a tool increases with the objective assessment of the actual uses to which the tool has been applied.</p>
<p><em>First Parallel Aspect:</em> In absolute essence, all values are equal. Each value mutually supports every other value on the same level of being. No single value excludes or precludes any other. <u>All</u> values coexist and support all other values. Only by having <u>all</u> values may one have <u>any</u> values.</p>
<p><em>Second Parallel Aspect:</em> In absolute essence, all purposes are unequal to all other purposes. Each purpose on each level of being precludes all others on that same level of being. Purposes on one level of being may be component parts of those on other levels, implementing them. Only one purpose may be held at a time. Purposes will always contain or exclude other purposes.</p>
<p>Purpose is a reflection of want. Meaningfulness is a reflection of desire. Value is a reflection of need.<br />
Purpose, value, and meaning are explicit and objective.<br />
Want, need, and desire are implicit and subjective.</p>
<p>The concepts of practicality and efficiency refer to purpose. Alone, they do not have value or meaning.<br />
To over emphasize purpose, function, and work is to risk losing one's values, self worth, and feeling of the significance of life, the meaning of one's own and the value of all others.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Life</h3>
<p>To consider progress is to assume purpose. What may be the purposes of one may not always be the purposes of another. Progress to one may be regress to another.</p>
<p>Meaning, in contrast with value and purpose, cannot be held either by self or other. Meaning is always (and only) in between both self and other. Meaning is neither given nor taken, neither shared nor not shared. Meaning <em>is</em> — and has being — at all scales, from the smallest to the ultimate (the All).</p>
<p>Purpose is individual. Evolution is universal. Evolution is not progress.<br />
Evolution is the purpose of life to become more alive.</p>
<p>Meaning, meaningfulness, and significance are cooperative. Ultimately, both purpose and value are also cooperative. Purposes, which on the surface appear to be contradictory, are at a deeper level seen to be consonant (are seen as a truthful reflection of desire).</p>
<p>Nothing is purely dynamic or perfectly static. Nothing is purely chaotic or perfectly logical.<br />
Nothing is perfectly random or absolutely deterministic. Nothing is purely chosen or purely causal.</p>
<p>The significance of something, a life, event or act, is present tense; it is not defined by the past or by its eventual future. Significance in the present defines the meaning of the past, and the meaningfulness of the future.<br />
Meaningfulness defines both value and purpose.</p>
<p>To say that something has had value int he past, or to say that something will have purpose in the future, is only to know significance in the present; neither more nor less. The meaningfulness of an eventity, a self, a life, is independent of its temporality.</p>
<p>Significance is scale, position, and direction invariant. It does not matter what size, what duration, how permanent or impermanent something may be, its significance will be the same. Significance does not depend on large and small, high or low, near or far; it applies at all levels of being equally. The significance of a life does not depend on where one lives, who or what one knows, what one has or what one does. Significance is innate, independent of all state and function, worth and means.</p>
<p>A symbol (work of art, event, the life of a self, subjective expression, etc.) has <em>value</em>, connotation, potentiality and strength in proportion to the number of interdomain<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-050'>[50]</a> relationships that describe it.</p>
<p>A symbol (life, etc.) has <em>purpose</em>, denotation, actuality, and power in proportion to the number of intradomain relationships that define it.</p>
<p>A symbol (life, etc.) has <em>meaning</em> and significance in proportion to the product of the number and the degree of the interdomain and intradomain relations in which that symbol is so involved.</p>
<p>The degree of the perfection of value is the product of the degree to which one values all things, and the degree to which one values all things equally.</p>
<p>The perfection of purpose increases with depth, coherency, and the degree to which it is manifested (expressed) through other purposes and actions with clarity, purity, and accuracy.</p>
<p>The degree to which one realizes meaning and significance in life is in proportion to the product of the degree of one's perfection of value (perception/expression) and the degree of one's perfection of purpose (expression/creativity).</p>
<p>Life is increased and made greater when always seeking to be creative and joyful (artistic). Life diminishes and becomes less when always trying to make life easy and comfortable (practical).</p>
<p>Life is significant and meaningful more than it is purposeful or valued. The purpose and value of one's life will always find its basis in the meaningfulness of one's life.</p>
<p>The significance of a single life can only be known by its connections to other lives. The significance of a single world can be known only by its connection to other worlds. To know the meaning of any existence (any single life), one must know the meaning of many existences (many lives, worlds, and domains).</p>
<p>The strongest, most affirming, and sustaining value is the acceptance of diversity in all creativity and experience. The deepest purpose, taking precedence over all others, is the desire to realize the maximum possible creativity and experience.</p>
<p>All experiences and creations are valid, valued, and valuable.<br />
No one experience or creation is any less or more valid than any other.<br />
Experiences and creations of lesser intensity are as valid as experiences of greater intensity.</p>
<p>The degree of significance in life increases dramatically when approaching the absolute limits of perfection of value and purpose.</p>
<p>There is no life without significance, and there is no significance that is not alive.<br />
Life and meaningfulness are intrinsic to one another; they are never separate.</p>
<p>Life <strong>is</strong> its own purpose, value, and meaning. All that is life, all that is alive, is valued and sacred.<br />
THe purpose, meaning, and value of all life is to live, to live well and fully, on all levels of being and in all worlds.</p>

<h3>Equanimity</h3>
<p>Ultimately, all of consciousness in all times and places and in all worlds has the same absolute intent: to maximize the degree of both experience <u>and</u> creativity. This is the <em>reality</em> of love: the actuality of potentiality <em>and</em> the potentiality of all actuality.</p>
<p>The universe values all experiences and creations equally; it has no favorites. Everything is intrinsically significant. Experience/creation cannot not be meaningful, valuable, and purposeful<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-051'>[51]</a>. All creativity, all life, is valued and significant as <em>being</em> creative and alive.</p>
<p>To negate the significance and value of <em>any</em> life is to negate the significance of <u>all</u> life.<br />
Either everything (at all scales of being, in all worlds, at all times) is sacred, or nothing is.</p>
<p>Heaven will open only to those who know all is sacred. Hell will imprison only those who think nothing is sacred.</p>
<p>All interactions, perceptions, and expressions are inherently unique.<br />
No interaction can replace, or take the place of, any other. No experience can replace any other experience.<br />
All experiences and all expressions (interactions, communications, and integrations) are equally valued.</p>
<p>A great degree of experience, creativity, or intimacy in one domain, does not and cannot, replace experience, creativity, or intimacy in any other domain. No amount of interaction, existence, and creation in any one world can replace any amount of interaction, existence, and creation in any other world.</p>
<p>No amount of objective causality will replace any amount of subjective experience.<br />
No amount of subjective choice will replace any amount of objective expression.<br />
They are of equal value.</p>
<p>No degree of knowing is equivalent to any degree of understanding.<br />
No degree of understanding is equivalent to any degree of knowing.<br />
Understanding cannot replace or create knowing. Knowing cannot replace or create understanding.</p>
<p>The content of all worlds is imperfect and temporary. The content and inner nature of all of self is perfect and eternal (timeless). The imperfect and the temporary are as important and as valuable as the perfect and the eternal. Value is realized in equality.</p>
<p>Ensure that no single domain can account for, or is the source of, all of one's experience.</p>
<p>Values can be shared by all<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-052'>[52]</a> It is possible and reasonable to value everything; to consider all life and all aspects of life as sacred. Effectiveness, meaningfulness, and life is best realized when regarding <u>All</u> as sacred and significant.</p>
<p>Values are realized, clear, and pure in proportion to the degree to which they are specific, known, and local to self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-053'>[53]</a>. The greater the clarity and the more positive the statement of value, the more meaningful and rapid its resolution in manifestation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the value involved, one cannot enforce or impress any value on another.<br />
There can only be disagreement about purposes, not about values<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-054'>[54]</a>.<br />
There are no necessary value conflicts. All values can be upheld and co-exist without conflict.</p>
<p>It is never an error to value more or to value too much. There can only be the mistake (the sin) of valuing too little. Each value enables one to have more (and other) values. True sacredness will never diminish other sacredness.</p>
<p>It is ineffective to ask one to value something less; it is always more effective to ask one to value more.<br />
All that can be asked is for one to value other things <u>in addition</u> to what they already value<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-055'>[55]</a>.</p>
<p>Values cannot transcend themselves.<br />
Any attempt to do so is to leave the system of values and shift into the realm of purpose.</p>
<p>Value IS, and cannot not be. Value is unbounded and formless; it cannot be constrained or modified by anything which exists. One cannot not have values.</p>
<p>Values are always defined positively. To express a value is to assert a willingness of acceptance.<br />
To live a value is to fully accept the being of other (all other, another, and the world).</p>
<p>Complete non-acceptance is impossible. Complete isolation of self is impossible.</p>
<p>To be truly and vibrantly alive, some element of wildness (some absence of conditioning, constraint, and control) is necessary. When and where wildness ceases, the most vital and dynamic aspect of life and creation also dies.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=51>
<li id='footnote-051'><p>This applies to each experience, each creation, and each type of experience and creation. An accidental experience regarded as 'undesirable' or painful is equally valued by "the all" as the chosen experience of one's desire.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-052'><p>Ultimately, others will hold the same values as oneself. The same deepest values underlie all. It is not reasonable, however, to believe that others will hold the same *purposes* as oneself. It would be very unlikely, except at very deep layers of soul.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-053'><p>To realize and implement "I love everything" (as a value) is vague, difficult, and ambiguous. To enumerate one's values in detail is to allow for more immediate and direct realization.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-054'><p>Purposes can be coordinated, but are infrequently shared. One cannot expect or convince others to hold the same purposes as oneself.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-055'><p>If one were engaged in an argument about one's values, then that argument is <u>fundamentally irresolvable</u> and shall be dropped without conclusion. While purposes can be considered in terms of logic, value is not logical, and thus, cannot be corrected. Resolution of misunderstandings of this type occur most naturally with the gradual adoption of all the values help by the other; those values not yet known to the self.</p></li>

<h3>Errors of Extrema</h3>
<p><em>The Errors of Extrema of Self:</em></p>
<p><strong>Prejudice:</strong> When expression is ultimately/absolutely independent of perception.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction:</strong> When expression is ultimately/absolutely dependent on perception<br />
(where reaction is mechanistic/deterministic).</p>
<p><em>The Errors of Extrema of World:</em></p>
<p><strong>Realism:</strong> Where perception is ultimately/absolutely independent of expression.</p>
<p><strong>Idealism:</strong> Where perception is ultimately/absolutely dependent on expression.</p>
<p>There is neither absolute dependence nor absolute independence; there is only interdependence (interaction). Ultimately only interaction is real. <strong>None</strong> of the extrema are valid. Therefore, avoid the extrema!</p>
<p><em>First Parallel Aspect:</em> For a world to seem realistic, descriptions of events at mesoscopic scales should be given in the terms of being caused by events at microscopic scales. The effect of realism is in proportion to the degree of literalness involved and the degree of difference in apparent scale between the microscopic causes and the mesoscopic outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Second Parallel Aspect:</em> For a world to seem idealistic, descriptions of events at mesoscopic scales should be given in the terms of being chosen by events at macroscopic scales. The effect of idealism is in proportion to the degree of symbolism involved and the degree of difference in apparent scale between the macroscopic choices and the mesoscopic outcomes.</p>
<p><em>First Parallel Aspect:</em> Dynamics which tend to increase the degree of objectivity in the self-to-world relation will result in a proportional increase in the degree of actuality of that world, and a decrease in the degree of potentiality of what that world could be. These are processes which tend to place the self in a more fixed and constant (symmetric) relation to a world.</p>
<p><em>Second Parallel Aspect:</em> Dynamics which tend to increase the degree of subjectivity in the self-to-world relation will result in a proportional increase in the degree of the potentiality of that world, and a decrease in the degree of actuality of what that world is. These are processes which tend to place the self in a more dynamic and changing (continuous) relation to a world.</p>
<p><em>First Parallel Aspect:</em> It is best to maintain symmetry in all aspects of relationship with the world (that which is objective, of or relating to form and substance, experience, causality, perception, content, the seen, the macroscopic, the actual intradomain interactions).</p>
<p><em>Second Parallel Aspect:</em> It is best to maintain continuity in all aspects of relationship with the self (that which is subjective, of or relating to feeling and essence, creativity, choice, expression, context, the unseen, the microscopic, and potential interdomain interactions).</p>
<h3>The Six Paths</h3>
<p>Greatness has aspects of form (as in ideas) and feeling (as in the arts).<br />
The most effective philosophies, the greatest ideas of an age,<br />
have equal components of science, spirituality, and mysticism.<br />
The most effective arts, the greatest works of art in an age,<br />
have equal components of technology, religion, and magic.</p>
<p>The greatest ideas of an age involve a scientific perspective. There needs to be discipline, rigor, and clarity of thinking. A great idea involves spirituality. It requires high degrees of acceptance and openness to be appreciated in the context of one's previous assumptions, presuppositions, and beliefs. A great idea involves deep insight, intuition, and the qualities of feeling, dreaming, and the unconsciousness of a mystic, as well as thought and work. Only when significant degrees of science, spirituality, and mysticism are used together is there any chance of developing a new, great philosophy.</p>
<p>A great work of art involves technology in the effective execution and skill of the artist (the artist's technique). A great work of art involves religion as a source of the archetypal symbols and languages needed to convey an insightful meaning. A great work of art involves magic in its deep ability to change the perception, attention, and consciousness (state of feeling) of anyone who experiences/perceives that work of art. Only when a significant degree of all three (technology, religion, and magic) are present is it possible for a new, great work of art to be created.</p>
<p><strong>The Action of the Six Paths:</strong><br />
The practice of spirituality is the process of using learning to create acceptance within the self.<br />
The practice of science is the process of using method to create knowledge within the self.<br />
The practice of mysticism is the process of using divination to create wisdom within the self.<br />
The practice of religion is the process of using ceremony to create symbols within the world.<br />
The practice of technology is the process of using engineering to create understanding within the world.<br />
The practice of magic is the process of using ritual to create meaning within the world.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Transformations of Question:</strong><br />
The essential question of spirituality is Who.<br />
The essential question of science is Where.<br />
The essential question of mysticism is Why.<br />
The essential question of religion is How.<br />
The essential question of technology is When.<br />
The essential question of magic is What.</p>
<p><strong>What Comes Before, What the Means are, and What the Outcome is:</strong></p>
<p>There must be acceptance before there is learning.<br />
There must be learning before there is spirituality.<br />
There must be spirituality before there is acceptance.</p>
<p>There must be knowledge before there is method.<br />
There must be method before there is science.<br />
There must be science before there is knowledge.</p>
<p>There must be wisdom before there is divination.<br />
There must be divination before there is mysticism.<br />
There must be mysticism before there is wisdom.</p>
<p>There must be symbol before there is ceremony.<br />
There must be ceremony before there is religion.<br />
There must be religion before there is symbol.</p>
<p>There must be understanding before there is engineering.<br />
There must be engineering before there is technology.<br />
There must be technology before there is understanding.</p>
<p>There must be meaning before there is ritual.<br />
There must be ritual before there is magic.<br />
There must be magic before there is meaning.</p>
<h3>The Great Mystery</h3>
<p>Where is always a desire for creativity and experience (basal motivations), there are forever three Great Mysteries or avenues of exploration: the macroscopic, the microscopic, and the mesoscopic.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mystery of the Horizon</strong> refers to the macroscopic limit of the world, beyond which is the unknown and unknowable; that place which is too far away in time and space that is 'absolutely elsewhere'.<br />
It is the mystery of existence.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mystery of the Infinitesimal</strong> refers to the microscopic limit of the world; that scale at which knowledge of definite state or quality becomes impossible (Heisenberg uncertainty limits).<br />
It is the mystery of creation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mystery of the Subconscious</strong> refers to a mesoscopic limit: one's knowledge of one's own inner nature. It is the mystery of interaction. It is the mystery of the subjective, the subconscious; the essential nature of one's own mind and personal being.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Evolution</h2>
<h3>Gentleness</h3>
<p><strong>Gentleness</strong> is a reflection of inner stillness (peace) and sensitivity (connectedness).<br />
<strong>Inner stillness</strong> is proportional to the integrity and integration of Self.<br />
<strong>Sensitivity</strong> is proportional the degree of involvement with Reality<br />
(self-interaction, experience, and creativity with-in a world).</p>
<p>The being of the world is realized as actuality in terms of symmetry and discontinuity.<br />
The being of the self is realized as potentiality in terms of continuity and asymmetry.</p>
<p>The more one <u>lives a worldly life</u> (is in business), the more perfectly one must practice symmetry (as in government), and the more one must eventually find greater and greater extremes of discontinuity (disconnectedness and isolation).</p>
<p>The more one <u>lives a soulful life</u> (is in hermitage), the more perfectly one must practice continuity (as equanimity), and the more one must eventually find greater and greater extremes of asymmetry (messianic enlightenment).</p>
<p>The outer world is best characterized by laws of symmetry, causality, and discontinuity.<br />
The inner self is best characterized by principles of continuity, choice, and asymmetry (emanation).</p>
<p>It cannot not seem that the outer world is defined by experiences of discontinuity and pain.<br />
It cannot not seem that the inner self is defined by expressions of continuity and joy.</p>
<p><strong>Spirituality:</strong> The ability to remain whole and maintain a continuity and integrity of self.<br />
Acceptance and integration is the effective practice of spirituality (see page 137).</p>
<p><strong>Inner Peace:</strong> A faith and realization of the capacity of one's own spiritual nature, an ability to remain whole and to maintain a continuity and integrity of self, regardless of the degree of pain and suffering experience in the world of the body.</p>
<p>When the self can accept and integrate the experience of the deep world (of discontinuity) and remain whole (maintain a continuity and integrity of self) then one will be at peace. The realization of one's own spiritual qualities leads to an increase in one's knowledge of peace (a reduction in pain and suffering)<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-056'>[56]</a>.</p>
<p>It will always <u>appear and seem</u> to be a fact that all of the experience of any world will be one of pain and suffering<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-057'>[57]</a>. Joy, comfort, and connectedness (continuity), although equally real, cannot be seen or known objectively. They must always be, or seem to be, invisible, unseen, and subjective, a part of the Self. The appearance (illusion) of fact is <em>not</em> equivalent with the being (reality) of fact.</p>
<p>Any self-reflective consciousness in vivid and intimate contact with nature will tend to develop a high level of spiritual awareness. Living in nature inherently compels acceptance of situation, life, and truth. All forms of life in nature must ultimately accept nature as it is. The central dynamic of spirituality is about one's acceptance of that which is not self; a deep inner sense of spirituality enables continued survival in the face of suffering when alone.</p>
<p>When involved with others in social interchange, one's inner sense of spirituality combines with others to create a shared religion<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-058'>[58]</a>. Living in a society inherently requires that all members of that society be accepted by and into that society. Religion provides a defined code of morality for how to interact socially with others in that same culture. The central dynamic of religion is about being accepted into that which is not self. A deep religious nature enables continued membership and support in the face of suffering when with others.</p>
<p>The interface between self and world, experience and expression, has intensity to the degree that a great integrity of self (perfect continuity) is brought into close and intimate contact with the deep world (perfect discontinuity).</p>
<p>The integrity of self must precede the connected with the world (experience). Wellness must take precedence over fullness. The maximum level of intensity with which one may have contact with a world must always be slightly less than the maximum level of integrity that one has within the self.</p>
<p>The rapidity and persistence of the changes one makes in the world increases with both the degree of intensity and the degree of coordination of one's interactions with that world.</p>
<p>One's actions, interactions, and expressions have maximum effectiveness when equal attention is given to: the intensity, the feeling, and the form of the conscious choices which compose them. As such, optimum expressions of intention and thought will combine passion and emotion with quality, symbolism, and romance without giving up their literal meaning, logic, or factual nature.</p>
<p>Significance is maximized when the degree of inward awareness (toward the soul) is in direct proportion to the degree that ones lives and has outward awareness (toward the world). Maximum effectiveness is realized when increased intimacy with self, the knowing of self, is used in balance with outward attention.</p>
<p>For most people to experience and reflect beauty, joy, contentment, peace, and desire, it is necessary for them to live inwardly toward the core of self, increasing interaction, connectedness, and potentiality there. Bring awareness inward to increase significance in life.</p>
<p>The degree of <strong>intimacy</strong> is proportional to the degree of similarity and the degree of proximity. Optimum significance is attained when the soul works in divine, direct, intimate, cooperative (loving) participation with all of life.</p>
<p><strong>The Meaningfulness of Life:</strong> to live well and fully. 'Well' means to maintain a high degree of internal integrity (symmetry) of Self; to live a healthy and wholesome life. 'Fully' means to maintain a high degree of connectedness (continuity) between self and reality; to be fully present in life.</p>
<p>To truly acknowledge life is to expand from the motivations of "being comfortable in life" (driven by purpose or simple values of material acquisition) to the motivation to increase significance in life (driven by clarity, artistry, and creativity). This results in making choices on a day to day basis which are healthier and more enabling for all.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=56>
<li id='footnote-056'><p>To the extent that one is deeply involved with the world (to the extent that one lives), there is potential for the nature of the discontinuity of the world to be carried inward; toward the self. When the experience of the deep world is not accepted and integrated into the matrix of self, the self becomes increasingly disconnected and isolated and the experience of the world becomes one of pain and suffering.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-057'><p>With careful examination it can be seen that the central concern of most great religions is suffering and its resolution (a mythos of redemption via acceptance by divinity). Considering theology is often a means to an end intimately bound up with issues and assumptions regarding personal fear, pain, and suffering.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-058'><p>With increasing degrees of separation from nature and more involvement in social interactions, these shared religions are increasingly defined in terms of form, rather than in terms of a capacity to create deep feeling.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Spirituality and Religion</h3>
<p>Spirituality and religion are distinct ideas and practices.<br />
Spirituality relates to the integration of a world into oneself.<br />
Religion relates to the integration of oneself into a world.</p>
<p><strong>Spirituality</strong> is about how one perceives and experiences, how one accepts and integrates those perceptions and experiences into oneself. It is about how one integrates life's events, reflects upon them and learns from them. Spirituality is a philosophy about the role that a reality (a world) plays within oneself.</p>
<p><strong>Religion</strong> is about how one expresses with others for the common good, the greater social and natural environment in which one lives. It is about one's expressions and connections, choices, and how one integrates their choices into the community in which one lives. Religion is a philosophy about the role one plays in a world and about how that world accepts each self.</p>
<p>The essential difference between them, is that spirituality is a perceptive<br />
and subjective process; whereas religion is an expressive and objective process.<br />
Subjective experience is private, where objective expression is public.</p>
<p><em>First Parallel Aspect:</em> The depth of one's spiritual nature is proportional to the capacity and ability to accept and integrate all experience and all aspects of one's own inner nature. The greater the diversity and range of intensity that one can accept while still maintaining an integrity of self, the greater the level and quality of one's spirituality.</p>
<p>The measure of one's spirituality is defined in terms of the skill and ability to integrate personal experiences of the world into one's self.</p>
<p><em>Second Parallel Aspect:</em> The depth of one's religious nature is proportional to the capacity and ability to integrate personal expressions and choices into the world, the community, and the environment. The greater the diversity of intensities of expression and creativity one can express while maintaining the integrity and wholeness of the world (the environment and community in which one lives), the greater the level and quality of one's religion.</p>
<p>The measure of one's religious nature is defined in terms of the skill and ability to integrate one's expressions into the community and world in which one lives and acts.</p>
<p>Spirituality is primarily an inner, perceptive, and personal process. It is always private and is unremarked and unrecognized within culture and society.</p>
<p>Religion is primarily an external, expressive, and public process. Each religion is at least partially public and is recognized by at least one culture or society.</p>
<p>One feels and knows one's spirituality. One describes, defines, understands, and expresses one's religion.<br />
Spirituality is about being; religion is about doing. The nature of spirituality persists, even though it cannot be created. All religions are created.</p>
<p>Spirituality is known everywhere by everyone, yet is identified nowhere and by no one.<br />
Religion is understood by no one, yet is identified by everyone.<br />
Spirituality is always discovered and is never created or manufactured.<br />
Religion is always created and is never found or discovered.<br />
Spirituality is always discovered within the self and never in the world.<br />
Religion is always created within the world and never in the self.</p>
<p>Spirituality is neither human nor inhuman. Religion must be either human or inhuman.</p>
<p>Spirituality always refers to the inner self and has no name; whereas religion always refers to what is outside self and is always named. It is possible for one to join a religion, yet one cannot 'join' a spirituality. Spirituality has no name. Only religions have names. A named philosophy is a religion. If a philosophy (way of life) has neither name nor a socially recognized form, it is, in essence, spiritual.</p>
<p>Spirituality does not require a commitment to anything external to oneself. Spirituality requires no actions and no demonstrations, for it is in the process of one's being. A religion is defined by its actions, devotions, and worship, and requires commitment of oneself to another. Spirituality is defined in terms of one's being; it is only by one's actions that one is religious.</p>
<p>Even though one can appear and act in any number of ways, one cannot be other than oneself.<br />
For each self, there are many religions. For each self, there is only one spirituality.</p>
<p>There is no source for spirituality. Spirituality is not something that one obtains or attains.<br />
Spirituality has no source and no destination and it can neither be created nor destroyed.<br />
Spirituality has only beingness.</p>
<p>There can be no spirituality without a self (soul) and there is no self that is not to some degree spiritual<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-059'>[59]</a>.<br />
There can be no world without a religion, and there is no religion that is not bound to a world.</p>
<p>The very beingness of self begets a beingness of spirituality. The very beingness of a world begets the beingness of a religion. Each is of nature.</p>
<p>Religion begins with one's desire to express an inner felt spirituality. All great religions begin with one's own life. Religion need not be external, remote, impersonal, abstract, or absolute. One's home, the natural world on this planet, is where religion and life is.</p>
<p>By emphasizing and valuing clarity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-060'>[60]</a>, one is enabled to value diversity and complexity. Spirituality is about acceptance of life, which includes acceptance of its inherent diversity and complexity.</p>
<p>The process of evolution—the basis of diversity in life and love—requires one to accept that life will be complex<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-061'>[61]</a>. An overzealous attempt to 'simplify' life is unnatural; it can only result in suffering.</p>
<p>For every way in which something is simple, there are at least two ways in which it is complex. Yet it is also true that for every aspect of complexity, there are always at least two ways in which it can be simple.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=59>
<li id='footnote-059'><p>Some type of spirituality is a basic and intrinsic part of everyone's life. In that life cannot be lived without perception or experience, and the implicit integration of these into self, one also cannot not be to some degree spiritual. In that life cannot be lived without expression, choice, and creativity, and at least implicit integration of these into a world, one also cannot not be to some degree religious. In that there is a social need for unity on the part of all people, there is some aspect of religion in everyone's life.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-060'><p>Clarity is distinct from simplicity. An emphasis on simplicity is <i>not</i> central to the realization of spirituality and enlightenment. The practices of simplicity, such as abstinence, asceticism, and minimalism, are means to an end: the realization of true clarity. The desire and practice of "spiritual simplicity" must always be grounded and return to an underlying desire for clarity. True clarity, particularly regarding the meaningfulness of life, can always be obtained in more than one way.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-061'><p>There are many examples of why complexity must be accepted in conjunction with simplicity. Relationships with loved ones are richer to the degree that they involve many different aspects of our lives. The web of nature is beautiful and alive because of its complex diversity. Ecology is healthy and vibrant in proportion to the degree that the web of life is rich and wild. One's own body—a marvel of personal biology, ecology, and chemistry—is vastly complex.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Worship and Respect</h3>
<p>Worship is not respect. They are distinct and non-interchangeable.</p>
<p>The term <strong>worship</strong> characterizes the behavior of one who believes there is some <em>irreducible difference</em> in the basic nature of the being of self and the being of the object or personae of worship (deity).</p>
<p>The term <strong>respect</strong> characterizes the behavior of one who believes there is a basic <em>sameness and similarity</em> in the nature of being of the self and the object or personae of that respect.</p>
<p>Deity, spirit, and soul act only in a personal manner; never in a social one.<br />
To be truly spiritual is to trust oneself and one's own experience.<br />
The highest spirituality, divinity, and enlightenment is within.<br />
The inner nature of self is always inherently good.</p>
<p>All of life is valid. The validity of one's own life is intrinsic.<br />
It is Truly Owned and cannot be diminished or taken away.</p>
<h3>Satisfaction and Enlightenment</h3>
<p>Happiness cannot be sought; it is a state of being, one must remain receptive to it.</p>
<p>Having options, opportunities, and potentials (choice) is as important as goals actualization, and fulfillment (consequence). 'Potentiality' is equally as important as 'reality'.</p>
<p>Satisfaction is a function of both anticipation and realization, and is dependent on a fullness of both.<br />
<strong>Satisfaction</strong> is the product of both expectation and realization.</p>
<p>The sense of satisfaction with being is proportional to the product of<br />
the degree to which one thinks they have chosen/created/defined purpose and have purposes, and<br />
the degree to which one feels they have experienced meaning, beauty, and have value.</p>
<p>Fulfillment, happiness, and joy increase in proportion to the right totality of interaction between self and reality. Too little interaction, uniqueness, and intensity (significance) in life leads to chronic sadness and diminishment of life<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-062'>[62]</a>. However, too much intensity and interaction can cause stress, strain, and harm to growth. Satisfaction results from living in the balance of one's capacity, neither more nor less.</p>
<p>The personal and global evolution of both perception and self is the process of becoming more authentic, more defined, and more refined. This includes the development of both feeling (quality) and form (quantity). One's evolution is Truly Owned.</p>
<p><strong>Enlightenment</strong> is to become full of light. To be full of light one must have clarity and be clear. The purification and clarification of self allows for the divine nature of our innermost self to shine through, affecting and enhancing all of one's actions and insights.</p>
<p>Reality and Self are inseparable, regardless of one's level of spiritual evolution or enlightenment.<br />
It is in the full realization of self, reality, and their communion, a totality of being, that one knows enlightenment.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is a full realization of the nature of life, in all worlds. It has little to do with 'departure from the cycle of life'. One does not "transcend" the being of self and world (enlightenment is not 'escapism'), one evolves with and within them. There is always a life (living), and a context of life (nature), no matter how evolved one may be, or in which world one chooses to live.</p>
<p>There is no "perfect" consciousness (pure action or doing) or pure spirit. There is no purely undivided (whole) consciousness. One can only approach ever closer to wholeness and holiness.</p>
<p>Some degree of unconsciousness, unawareness and the unknown must always be present to ensure a separation of identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Diversity is as valued as unity.</p>

<h3>Soul, Mind, and Body</h3>
<p>The term 'self' has three distinct meanings, which are distinguished by the terms 'Soul', 'Mind', and 'Body':</p>
<p><strong>Soul</strong> refers to that which is purely internal, subjective, and which consists of a pure formless quality.</p>
<p><strong>Mind</strong> refers to the boundary and dynamics between the internal subjective quality and the external, objective form.</p>
<p><strong>Body</strong> refers to an objective symbol which is associated with a focus of choice and experience in relation to a world and which is projected into that world.</p>
<p>Soul, mind, and body are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.<br />
The mind is more fundamental than both body and soul.</p>
<p>Many dynamics within the soul are necessary to create a single process within the mind.<br />
Many processes within the mind precede each and every action in the body.<br />
Many events in the body precede each dynamic within the soul.</p>
<p>The soul of self <strong>is</strong> potentiality, choice, and desire.<br />
Soul does not have size, composition, or position, as does the body.</p>
<p>The soul is integral. It cannot be analyzed, decomposed, or considered in terms of components and parts. Soul is free, undefined, and indefinable. Body is fixed, limited, defined, and definable. Only the body has structure, pattern, and form; the soul has only quality — a feeling that is without structure, pattern, or form.</p>
<p>Soul is not observable. It cannot be studied using the methods of science nor can it be measured using technology. Soul is not subject to experiment; only body can be the target of such examination.</p>
<p>No degree of understanding the body equates to any amount of knowledge about the soul.<br />
No degree of knowledge of the soul equates to any amount of understanding of the body.</p>
<p>From the perspective of mind, the relation of attention between body and soul are mutually complementary.<br />
Effectiveness in life requires the maximum combination of attention to all three aspects of self: mind, body, and soul.</p>
<p>As a subjective context, soul <em>is</em>; soul is everywhere (has no position, location, or structure of being), and is everywhere unique. The pure, perfect essence of one's soul is a specific and exact quality (color, timbre, tonality), the spectrum of which is infinitely detailed, rich, refined, and in all respects unique.</p>
<h3>Self of the Dream</h3>
<p>In any event of dreaming, in all dynamics of life, there are always at least three natures of self involved.</p>
<p><strong>The Dreamer Self:</strong> the aspect of self that creates the dream and acts from the point of view of creating the dream. It creates the stage upon which the play of the dream is enacted. The dreamer self corresponds to the mind.</p>
<p><strong>The Dreamed Self:</strong> the aspect of self that acts from the point of view of being within the dream context (created by the dreamer, along with all of the other dream content). It is the actor, a character on the stage of the dream and participates within that context. The dreamed self corresponds to the body.</p>
<p><strong>The Dreaming Self:</strong> the aspect of self that is apart from, independent of, both the dreamer self and the dreaming self. It neither creates nor participates in the dream; it has its being and activity in another (world) context altogether. For example, it is the self associated with the sleeping body (the Earth Object Domain, the common world "real life"). The dreaming self corresponds to the soul.</p>
<p>In any domain, these three aspects of self are intrinsic, always implicit. They are Truly Owned.<br />
Their beingness can never be taken away or diminished.</p>
<p>In every event of life in any world, there will always be (cannot not be) these three aspects of self.</p>
<p>To come to full and balanced consciousness in all three aspects, all three modalities of being, is to be and become <strong>enlightened</strong> within the context of that world.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Statement of Intent</h3>
<p>This book contains a distillation and summary of the most useful and practical ideas of the Immanent Metaphysics. These ideas are presented with the intent of enabling the reader to lead a more meaningful, healthy life. This book represents a personal search for those concepts believed to be of maximum value and usefulness in making effective choices. The intent is to provide the philosophical foundations necessary for people in western culture to enhance the quality of all life.</p>
<p>Rather than attempt to be a final work on the philosophy of choice, the aim of this book is to provide potent seed ideas and concepts for further reflection and development. The ideas presented herein are starting points for deeper consideration, meditation, an devolution. As a summary, this book contains only as much text as is needed to gracefully outline those notions which are of maximum significance and importance in the living of a high quality life. Emphasis on clarity and essence is inherent in this philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Format of Presentation</h3>
<p>In order to be of the greatest possible value, this book has been formatted as a series of related 'aphorisms'. An aphorism is a short and precise statement of an essential principle. Although the writing of aphorisms is not the usual prose form in philosophical literature, it has the significant advantage of ensuring clear access to the prime ideas and concepts of this philosophy. Individual aphorisms allow maximum emphasis on essentials while using a minimum of text.</p>
<p>As such, this book contains no exhaustive (and exhausting) explanations, metaphors or statements of implication. While such content might date understanding <em>in the short-term,</em> it can often result in long-term misunderstanding. Requiring the reader to wade through many histories, metaphors, an examples can obscure those essential concepts intended for immediate practical application.</p>
<p>Emphasis on a precise meaning is not to be construed as an attempt to logically prove the formal correctness of any of the assertions herein<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-001'>[1]</a>. This work is intended to provide maximum benefit to those who would actually <u>apply</u> these ideas. It is expected that the readers of this book will be interested in satisfying the immediate concerns of their daily lives.</p>
<p>This summary of seed ideas and concepts is not an attempt to "convince" anyone of anything. Readers looking to be convinced that some philosophical proposition is 'absolutely true' must do their own research to determine, prove, and validate their own notions of truth.</p>
<p>The process of learning and finding truth is more effective when one searches for what is true, rather than that which is false. It is of little use to "be convinced" of something, or to spend all of one's time trying to disprove or contradict some assertion. Such rejection is usually based on a misunderstanding, and thus fails to accomplish anything more than confusion. it is far more effective to consider the insight offered by each assertion in the manner in which that insight may be applied. It is hoped that the reader will recognize and eventually trust that there is a reason for every word of statement, every particularity of phrasing in these aphorisms.</p>

    <li id='footnote-001'>It is expected that most readers would find little significance in speculating whether this book is momentarily satisfies the technical demands of a handful of abstract theorists. However, there is a formal basis and foundation for all of the content in this book. Readers who are interested in the deeper metaphysical dynamics underlying all of this material should contact the author for more information.</li>
</ol>

<h3>A Reader's Covenant</h3>
<p>Beyond a certain natural point, a concept cannot be further simplified without damaging its essence. Most of the content herein has already been distilled to the maximum extent possible. Each word of each statement has been carefully considered and selected for maximum correctness and utility of meaning. The omission of a single word via misquoting, or even a slight change of ordering, can subtly damage and distort the intended meaning. Therefore, the author asks that the reader not attempt to simplify this material for presentation to others.</p>
<p>Distortions of significance (a loss of clarity when attempting to oversimplify an idea) can occur in ways that remain unnoticed, even though they eventually cause much misunderstanding, and if unchecked, mis-application. Therefore, the tendency (and the common desire) to simplify these concepts must be avoided. To realize the best possible long-term benefit of these ideas in our culture please <u>keep the aphorisms intact</u>.</p>
<h3>How to Read this Book</h3>
<p>The aphorisms in this manuscript refer to one another and are mutually interdependent. Some aspects of the meaning of each aphorism will only become clear when reading other areas of the text. As such, the reader is encouraged to always continue forward and develop comparisons, rather than to become 'stuck' at any particular point trying to understand one individual statement. The reader should <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong> expect to immediately comprehend all aspects of the various meanings and applications of each statement made. Reading through the entire manuscript more than once is necessary for complete understanding.</p>
<p>Although the aphorisms have been sequenced in such a manner as to encourage a gradual building of understanding and concept, there is no requirement that they be read in any specific order. The reader is encouraged to occasionally skip around and read those sections of the book that seem 'more interesting' in the moment.</p>
<p>Although you may skip sections to follow your interest, those sections that are chosen should be read very slowly, with total feeling and thoughtfulness. Do not try to 'skim' or read quickly through any part of this text. Approach each statement with full attention, when you are at peace of mind. Consider the complete and full meaning of each statement from several viewpoints before proceeding to the next.</p>
<p>By design, aphorisms implicitly contain several meanings and concepts in addition to those ideas more overtly stated. In most cases, individual assertions can be interpreted in more than one manner. Many of the statements presented here in have carefully-considered, multi-layered meanings. Wherever possible, each interpretation and connotation has been considered (and assured) to be metaphysically valid in many contexts.</p>
<p>Each individual aphorism is intended to be a basis for deep reflective consideration. Such meditation will reveal insights into concepts and aspects which are merely implied. It is better to read a little bit at a time, on some consistent interval, than to attempt to read many pages at one sitting. It is also helpful to meditate for a short interval both before and after reading any portion of this book.</p>
<p>In order to gain more value from the content, the reader is encouraged to consider each passage on several occasions, at varying times of the day and season. In re-reading, points which seemed confusing at first may become easier to understand. Some connections between ideas, reflections, and continuations will be known only when one has read far enough in the text to encounter alternate ends of the same thought.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of <u>Life</u></h2>
<h3>The Nature of Self</h3>
<p>Consciousness is.<br />
Consciousness is inseparable from all that is real and all that has being (both in parts and in wholes).</p>
<p>Choice is an intrinsic of consciousness.<br />
No one and no thing (nothing) can take away the reality and beingness of choice for any self, ever.<br />
Others may be able to influence what choices are apparently available; however, they cannot influence the fact that <u>self makes choice</u>.</p>
<p>Choice applies and is available to all of being, and all levels and aspects of being, for all time. There is no single level or 'unit' of being at which choice only applies, for all of self is involved in the action of choosing. There is no part or level of self which is without choice.</p>
<p>One's being, the eventity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-002'>[2]</a> of <strong>self</strong>, is the <u>product</u> of<br />
the sum of all of the choices that one has made, and<br />
the sum of all of the choices that one could make.</p>
<p>Self does not own or have choice; rather, self is the evolving context of many choices.<br />
The self arises our of the many common contexts of choice.<br />
The nature of choice is more basic, more fundamental, than the nature of self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-003'>[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Self (consciousness, mind) is neither the purely subjective, nor the purely objective; it is a dynamic of transformation, the boundary and interconnection between the inner subjective and the outer objective.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=2>
    <li id='footnote-002'>The term <b>Eventity</b> refers to the combination of the meanings of an entity (thing) and an event. Each interaction, comparison, and being is an eventity.</li>
    <li id='footnote-003'>Technically, a more correct assertion is that 'choice makes self' or that <u>choice has Self</u>. Self is an intrinsic of choice. The idea that 'self has or makes choice' is inaccurate since choice is not 'owned' or 'had' by the self so much as a singularity of self (the common context of selection) is the outcome of a plurality of choices.</li>
</ol>

<h3>True Ownership</h3>
<p><strong>Law of True Ownership:</strong> "None can take from you that which you truly own".<br />
If someone or something can take some thing, some property, or some quality away, even in principle, then it was never truly owned; it is not a part of one's unique Self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-004'>[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Those things which are not Truly Owned are not owned at all.<br />
There can be no ownership of that which is external to oneself.</p>
<p>True ownership is not control. True ownership is not commercial.<br />
One cannot take true ownership, acquire it, give it away, or trade it for something else.</p>
<p>A <strong>Right</strong> refers to the potential to exercise any choice which is a direct enactment of the law of true ownership.</p>
<p>A <strong>Privilege</strong> refers to a/the potential to exercise a choice which requires the accommodation of another and which has been willingly granted by that other.</p>
<p>True ownership is a statement of right. It cannot be legislated.<br />
Only privileges can be legislated and traded commercially.</p>
<p>Self is always sovereign. The nature of the being of self is not and cannot ever be conditioned or constrained by anything or anyone.</p>
<p>No amount of external acceptance or validation will ever contribute to any degree of self-acceptance. To feel peace, one must accept oneself totally, fully, and unconditionally. This is the essence and the initiation of health, strength, integrity, and spirituality.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=4>
    <li id='footnote-004'>Examples: Experience, choice, time, and validity are Truly Owned.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Absolute Inner Security</h3>
<p>Security is defined in terms of interaction. It is found in a potentiality to act, regardless of what could happen or has happened. To know true security is to realize the stability and sacredness of one's innermost spiritual nature. True security is intrinsic to self; it cannot be found in any world; it cannot be taken away. Personal security is absolute and truly owned.</p>
<p>Real security (the feeling that one will remain whole, strong, healthy, integral) is something that can only originate from inside the self. It cannot be provided by any other person or organization. External security is <strong><em><u>always</u></em></strong> illusionary; it has no value.</p>
<p>Inner personal security is not the same as protection. To attain absolute protection is to require absolute isolation; the loss of all connection. Absolute isolation can never be obtained, even in principle. Absolute protection requires the absence of all love and life, the loss of all value and significance. Real security, safety, integrity, strength, and health are found only in the Truth of one's ever-continuing ability to choose.</p>
<p>The feeling of security and strength is found in one's awareness of their freedom of choice. In that one cannot not choose, and in that the capability to choose cannot be taken away (it also is Truly Owned), one may always remain secure in choice. The greatest security is in the potential to act, rather than in the prevention of possible acts and events. In this is found the basis of all Faith.</p>
<p>Creation is safe. Choice is safe. All selves are ultimately safe in all worlds.</p>
<p>There is no single domain, world, or universe. No single domain is more fundamental than any other.</p>
<p>All worlds contain some degree of selfness. All selves will always have some positive (non-zero) degree of effective choice in that world. All effective choice will have causal consequences and implement real changes.</p>
<p>The core of self does not belong to any single domain; it is always a part of the process of many domains.<br />
The self is an axis upon which many worlds turn.</p>
<p>One cannot become entrapped in a domain of one's own imagination. It is always possible to transition to another world. The potentiality to transition to another world is Truly Owned.</p>
<p>No physical boundaries can protect one from the innermost nature of spirit. One does not have to protect oneself from divinity (spirit). There can be no Fear of God(dess(es)).</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of <u>Will</u></h2>
<h3>Aspects of Choice</h3>
<p>The essence of choice is resolved into exactly three necessary and sufficient concepts: potentiality, selection, and consequence. Without all of these, there is no choice (an impossible condition).</p>
<p>For choice to be choice, it must have consequences<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-005'>[5]</a>. A choice that has no effects, or whose effects can be completely undone, is not actually a choice at all; it is inherently an illusion.</p>
<p><em>All that is without choice, change, and consequence (causality) is illusion.</em><br />
Only that which is at once choice, change, and causality is <strong>real</strong>.</p>
<p>The strength of feeling that one has choice is the multiplicative product of:
1. the degree to which one perceives the range of options from which they can choose.
2. the degree that each option has actuality/consequence.
3. the degree that the selection of such option is perceived to be unconstrained.</p>
<p>Choice, as free will and self-determination, is realized in the feeling of choosing without external influence, without reason, without any logical compulsion. In part, all choices are based on a feeling of desire deep within the self. There will always be an aspect of personal choice which is not dictated by anything external to oneself.</p>
<p>The focus and strength of choice is at a maximum where attention is at maximum. The nature, range, and possible effects of choice are defined by the scale, position, and orientation of attention. A change in attention necessarily implies a change in the apparent choices available to self.</p>
<p>One can only make choices in the present. One cannot choose in the past or in the future. In that the overwhelming majority of one's being is here and now, so also are one's choices most effective here and now. Focus in the present concentrates the effectiveness of choice.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Statement of Intent</h3>
<p>This book contains a distillation and summary of the most useful and practical ideas of the Immanent Metaphysics. These ideas are presented with the intent of enabling the reader to lead a more meaningful, healthy life. This book represents a personal search for those concepts believed to be of maximum value and usefulness in making effective choices. The intent is to provide the philosophical foundations necessary for people in western culture to enhance the quality of all life.</p>
<p>Rather than attempt to be a final work on the philosophy of choice, the aim of this book is to provide potent seed ideas and concepts for further reflection and development. The ideas presented herein are starting points for deeper consideration, meditation, an devolution. As a summary, this book contains only as much text as is needed to gracefully outline those notions which are of maximum significance and importance in the living of a high quality life. Emphasis on clarity and essence is inherent in this philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Format of Presentation</h3>
<p>In order to be of the greatest possible value, this book has been formatted as a series of related 'aphorisms'. An aphorism is a short and precise statement of an essential principle. Although the writing of aphorisms is not the usual prose form in philosophical literature, it has the significant advantage of ensuring clear access to the prime ideas and concepts of this philosophy. Individual aphorisms allow maximum emphasis on essentials while using a minimum of text.</p>
<p>As such, this book contains no exhaustive (and exhausting) explanations, metaphors or statements of implication. While such content might date understanding <em>in the short-term,</em> it can often result in long-term misunderstanding. Requiring the reader to wade through many histories, metaphors, an examples can obscure those essential concepts intended for immediate practical application.</p>
<p>Emphasis on a precise meaning is not to be construed as an attempt to logically prove the formal correctness of any of the assertions herein<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-001'>[1]</a>. This work is intended to provide maximum benefit to those who would actually <u>apply</u> these ideas. It is expected that the readers of this book will be interested in satisfying the immediate concerns of their daily lives.</p>
<p>This summary of seed ideas and concepts is not an attempt to "convince" anyone of anything. Readers looking to be convinced that some philosophical proposition is 'absolutely true' must do their own research to determine, prove, and validate their own notions of truth.</p>
<p>The process of learning and finding truth is more effective when one searches for what is true, rather than that which is false. It is of little use to "be convinced" of something, or to spend all of one's time trying to disprove or contradict some assertion. Such rejection is usually based on a misunderstanding, and thus fails to accomplish anything more than confusion. it is far more effective to consider the insight offered by each assertion in the manner in which that insight may be applied. It is hoped that the reader will recognize and eventually trust that there is a reason for every word of statement, every particularity of phrasing in these aphorisms.</p>
<div style='text-align: center; font-style: italic;'>
To search for meaning is to find it.<br/>
To fail to search for meaning is to be without it.

<li id='footnote-001'><p>It is expected that most readers would find little significance in speculating whether this book is momentarily satisfies the technical demands of a handful of abstract theorists. However, there is a formal basis and foundation for all of the content in this book. Readers who are interested in the deeper metaphysical dynamics underlying all of this material should contact the author for more information.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>A Reader's Covenant</h3>
<p>Beyond a certain natural point, a concept cannot be further simplified without damaging its essence. Most of the content herein has already been distilled to the maximum extent possible. Each word of each statement has been carefully considered and selected for maximum correctness and utility of meaning. The omission of a single word via misquoting, or even a slight change of ordering, can subtly damage and distort the intended meaning. Therefore, the author asks that the reader not attempt to simplify this material for presentation to others.</p>
<p>Distortions of significance (a loss of clarity when attempting to oversimplify an idea) can occur in ways that remain unnoticed, even though they eventually cause much misunderstanding, and if unchecked, mis-application. Therefore, the tendency (and the common desire) to simplify these concepts must be avoided. To realize the best possible long-term benefit of these ideas in our culture please <u>keep the aphorisms intact</u>.</p>
<h3>How to Read this Book</h3>
<p>The aphorisms in this manuscript refer to one another and are mutually interdependent. Some aspects of the meaning of each aphorism will only become clear when reading other areas of the text. As such, the reader is encouraged to always continue forward and develop comparisons, rather than to become 'stuck' at any particular point trying to understand one individual statement. The reader should <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong> expect to immediately comprehend all aspects of the various meanings and applications of each statement made. Reading through the entire manuscript more than once is necessary for complete understanding.</p>
<p>Although the aphorisms have been sequenced in such a manner as to encourage a gradual building of understanding and concept, there is no requirement that they be read in any specific order. The reader is encouraged to occasionally skip around and read those sections of the book that seem 'more interesting' in the moment.</p>
<p>Although you may skip sections to follow your interest, those sections that are chosen should be read very slowly, with total feeling and thoughtfulness. Do not try to 'skim' or read quickly through any part of this text. Approach each statement with full attention, when you are at peace of mind. Consider the complete and full meaning of each statement from several viewpoints before proceeding to the next.</p>
<p>By design, aphorisms implicitly contain several meanings and concepts in addition to those ideas more overtly stated. In most cases, individual assertions can be interpreted in more than one manner. Many of the statements presented here in have carefully-considered, multi-layered meanings. Wherever possible, each interpretation and connotation has been considered (and assured) to be metaphysically valid in many contexts.</p>
<p>Each individual aphorism is intended to be a basis for deep reflective consideration. Such meditation will reveal insights into concepts and aspects which are merely implied. It is better to read a little bit at a time, on some consistent interval, than to attempt to read many pages at one sitting. It is also helpful to meditate for a short interval both before and after reading any portion of this book.</p>
<p>In order to gain more value from the content, the reader is encouraged to consider each passage on several occasions, at varying times of the day and season. In re-reading, points which seemed confusing at first may become easier to understand. Some connections between ideas, reflections, and continuations will be known only when one has read far enough in the text to encounter alternate ends of the same thought.</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Life</h2>
<h3>The Nature of Self</h3>
<p>Consciousness is.<br />
Consciousness is inseparable from all that is real and all that has being (both in parts and in wholes).</p>
<p>Choice is an intrinsic of consciousness.<br />
No one and no thing (nothing) can take away the reality and beingness of choice for any self, ever.<br />
Others may be able to influence what choices are apparently available; however, they cannot influence the fact that <u>self makes choice</u>.</p>
<p>Choice applies and is available to all of being, and all levels and aspects of being, for all time. There is no single level or 'unit' of being at which choice only applies, for all of self is involved in the action of choosing. There is no part or level of self which is without choice.</p>
<p>One's being, the eventity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-002'>[2]</a> of <strong>self</strong>, is the <u>product</u> of<br />
the sum of all of the choices that one has made, and<br />
the sum of all of the choices that one could make.</p>
<p>Self does not own or have choice; rather, self is the evolving context of many choices.<br />
The self arises our of the many common contexts of choice.<br />
The nature of choice is more basic, more fundamental, than the nature of self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-003'>[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Self (consciousness, mind) is neither the purely subjective, nor the purely objective; it is a dynamic of transformation, the boundary and interconnection between the inner subjective and the outer objective.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=2>
<li id='footnote-002'><p>The term <b>Eventity</b> refers to the combination of the meanings of an entity (thing) and an event. Each interaction, comparison, and being is an eventity.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-003'><p>Technically, a more correct assertion is that 'choice makes self' or that <u>choice has Self</u>. Self is an intrinsic of choice. The idea that 'self has or makes choice' is inaccurate since choice is not 'owned' or 'had' by the self so much as a singularity of self (the common context of selection) is the outcome of a plurality of choices.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>True Ownership</h3>
<p><strong>Law of True Ownership:</strong> "None can take from you that which you truly own".<br />
If someone or something can take some thing, some property, or some quality away, even in principle, then it was never truly owned; it is not a part of one's unique Self<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-004'>[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Those things which are not Truly Owned are not owned at all.<br />
There can be no ownership of that which is external to oneself.</p>
<p>True ownership is not control. True ownership is not commercial.<br />
One cannot take true ownership, acquire it, give it away, or trade it for something else.</p>
<p>A <strong>Right</strong> refers to the potential to exercise any choice which is a direct enactment of the law of true ownership.</p>
<p>A <strong>Privilege</strong> refers to a/the potential to exercise a choice which requires the accommodation of another and which has been willingly granted by that other.</p>
<p>True ownership is a statement of right. It cannot be legislated.<br />
Only privileges can be legislated and traded commercially.</p>
<p>Self is always sovereign. The nature of the being of self is not and cannot ever be conditioned or constrained by anything or anyone.</p>
<p>No amount of external acceptance or validation will ever contribute to any degree of self-acceptance. To feel peace, one must accept oneself totally, fully, and unconditionally. This is the essence and the initiation of health, strength, integrity, and spirituality.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=4>
<li id='footnote-004'><p>Examples: Experience, choice, time, and validity are Truly Owned.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Absolute Inner Security</h3>
<p>Security is defined in terms of interaction. It is found in a potentiality to act, regardless of what could happen or has happened. To know true security is to realize the stability and sacredness of one's innermost spiritual nature. True security is intrinsic to self; it cannot be found in any world; it cannot be taken away. Personal security is absolute and truly owned.</p>
<p>Real security (the feeling that one will remain whole, strong, healthy, integral) is something that can only originate from inside the self. It cannot be provided by any other person or organization. External security is <strong><em><u>always</u></em></strong> illusionary; it has no value.</p>
<p>Inner personal security is not the same as protection. To attain absolute protection is to require absolute isolation; the loss of all connection. Absolute isolation can never be obtained, even in principle. Absolute protection requires the absence of all love and life, the loss of all value and significance. Real security, safety, integrity, strength, and health are found only in the Truth of one's ever-continuing ability to choose.</p>
<p>The feeling of security and strength is found in one's awareness of their freedom of choice. In that one cannot not choose, and in that the capability to choose cannot be taken away (it also is Truly Owned), one may always remain secure in choice. The greatest security is in the potential to act, rather than in the prevention of possible acts and events. In this is found the basis of all Faith.</p>
<p>Creation is safe. Choice is safe. All selves are ultimately safe in all worlds.</p>
<p>There is no single domain, world, or universe. No single domain is more fundamental than any other.</p>
<p>All worlds contain some degree of selfness. All selves will always have some positive (non-zero) degree of effective choice in that world. All effective choice will have causal consequences and implement real changes.</p>
<p>The core of self does not belong to any single domain; it is always a part of the process of many domains.<br />
The self is an axis upon which many worlds turn.</p>
<p>One cannot become entrapped in a domain of one's own imagination. It is always possible to transition to another world. The potentiality to transition to another world is Truly Owned.</p>
<p>No physical boundaries can protect one from the innermost nature of spirit. One does not have to protect oneself from divinity (spirit). There can be no Fear of God(dess(es)).</p>
<h2>Aphorisms of Will</h2>
<h3>Aspects of Choice</h3>
<p>The essence of choice is resolved into exactly three necessary and sufficient concepts: potentiality, selection, and consequence. Without all of these, there is no choice (an impossible condition).</p>
<p>For choice to be choice, it must have consequences<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-005'>[5]</a>. A choice that has no effects, or whose effects can be completely undone, is not actually a choice at all; it is inherently an illusion.</p>
<p><em>All that is without choice, change, and consequence (causality) is illusion.</em><br />
Only that which is at once choice, change, and causality is <strong>real</strong>.</p>
<p>The strength of feeling that one has choice is the multiplicative product of:
1. the degree to which one perceives the range of options from which they can choose.
2. the degree that each option has actuality/consequence.
3. the degree that the selection of such option is perceived to be unconstrained.</p>
<p>Choice, as free will and self-determination, is realized in the feeling of choosing without external influence, without reason, without any logical compulsion. In part, all choices are based on a feeling of desire deep within the self. There will always be an aspect of personal choice which is not dictated by anything external to oneself.</p>
<p>The focus and strength of choice is at a maximum where attention is at maximum. The nature, range, and possible effects of choice are defined by the scale, position, and orientation of attention. A change in attention necessarily implies a change in the apparent choices available to self.</p>
<p>One can only make choices in the present. One cannot choose in the past or in the future. In that the overwhelming majority of one's being is here and now, so also are one's choices most effective here and now. Focus in the present concentrates the effectiveness of choice.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=5>
<li id='footnote-005'><p>When "not choosing" has real consequences and effects, it too must necessarily be considered a choice.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Limitation and Freedom</h3>
<p>One cannot have freedom; one can only give freedom.<br />
One does not own love or freedom; one may only participate in its flow and unboundedness.</p>
<p>To be free is to be aware of potentiality and choice. Limitation is the realization of actuality and consequence.</p>
<p>Limitation and freedom always occur together; they are inseparable. Freedom has an intrinsic, inherent, and irreducible aspect which is limitation. Limitation has an aspect which is freedom. Never does a freedom occur without a limitation, and never does a limitation occur without a freedom.</p>
<p>Limitation is as necessary as freedom. Beingness requires focus<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-006'>[6]</a>. Diversity, separateness, limitation, the unknown, and forgetfulness are all to be valued as much as singularity, oneness, freedom, limitlessness, and knowing.</p>
<p>All choice involves both freedom and limitation.</p>
<p>There is nothing which is absolutely free and there is nothing which is absolutely limited and fixed. The action of creation is a realization of freedom, yet all acts of creation inherently involve limitation<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-007'>[7]</a>.</p>
<p>There is no "transcendence" of limitation. One can work with limitations by adding to them: expanding freedoms by adding other levels, dimensions, and qualities.</p>
<p>The limitations, patterns, and forms created or defined <em><u>by</u></em> the self are not limitations, patterns or forms <em><u>of</u></em> the self. Self has being in many other worlds than the one where these patterns, limitations, and forms are manifested, structured, and defined.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=6>
<li id='footnote-006'><p>Consider, for example, the action of discipline. Accepting a practice of discipline (a limitation) eventually results in a freedom to achieve optimal self-expression. There can be no limitation where there is no freedom, and there can be no freedom where there is no limitation. In being, the realization of either of the concepts of freedom and limitation implies the realization of the other.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-007'><p>Action is composed of many changes. Creation is composed of many choices, and always involves an element of freedom. Limitation always involves an element of causality. In the same way that limitation and freedom are inseparable, choice, change, and causality are also inseparable. They always occur together.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Cooperative Choice</h3>
<p>All of choice is creative. Personal choice is the participation of self in the universal aspect of creation.</p>
<p>All choice is cooperative. Choice can only be given, never taken.<br />
Both creation and choice are necessarily and fundamentally cooperative.</p>
<p>No other person's choices, nor any consensus belief system, can compel, force, or constrain anyone to choose or believe anything in particular.</p>
<p>In the same manner that everything participates in change and causality, everything also has potentiality, possibility, and choice. One cannot choose in such a way that another cannot have choice. One cannot even choose not to have choice; to voluntarily 'not choose' is also a choice. Choice is Truly Owned.</p>
<p>Choice is not conserved, finite, or limited; the self cannot "run out of choice(s)".<br />
Creativity is not conserved; there is always more creativity and more choices.<br />
Every choice creates and enables other choices. Choice always begets choice.</p>
<p>Every choice is unique unto itself and can only be made once.</p>
<p>Choice cannot take away from the beingness of choice itself.<br />
Choice in the past can never reduce the amount or degree of choice in the present<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-008'>[8]</a>.</p>
<p>Choice cannot absolutely fix or limit other choices. Choice can only enable other choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is never any control over that which is internal to self.<br />
Desire has no reason and cannot be permanently constrained.<br />
There is no control over creativity. Creation itself is not controllable or constrainable.</p>
<p>No form of control is absolute; all process has some aspect of a cooperative nature. There is no control, there is only influence. It is fundamentally impossible to completely and/or absolutely control or constrain anything, in any domain, under any circumstances, ever.</p>
<p>There are always other possibilities, probabilities, and potentialities. Any potentiality can be made actual.</p>
<p>There cannot not continue to be creation and evolution in all worlds and in all domains. Creation is not an event. Creation is an aspect of events, rather than their source.</p>
<p>Nothing within a world can prevent the creation of new events, the creation of a new world. One relation cannot ultimately limit the beingness of other relations. Interaction cannot prevent interaction; it can only beget it.</p>
<p>All perception involves expression and all expression involves perception. In all the worlds in which one perceives and has feeling, there cannot not be a possibility of expression, a symbol and form of the self; a body projected as substance within that world. This symbol of mediation is the focus through which one expresses within that world. Where one perceives and has feeling, one cannot be fully silent (secret).</p>
<p>Creativity does not happen somewhere or to someone; rather it is inherently everywhere and within everyone. One does not need to "tap into" something external to oneself to create, to heal, to know something or to have imagination. In the very process of living, each of these qualities will take its own form.</p>
<p>Therefore, have faith in innate creativity and self-expression.<br />
Where creativity is needed, it is always inherently available.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=8>
<li id='footnote-008'><p>Choice can set the context of other choices. While this shift in context could be viewed as a partial limitation and constraint on other choices, it is a choice to view it in this manner — a hidden choice that must also be considered as contributing to the total 'volume' of choice available to self in the present.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Choice Coordination</h3>
<p>Self is not a thing, and it is not single, nor is it simple. Self (mind) cannot be defined or accumulated by any assembly of parts or theories. There is no 'unit' of self. A self is the product and integral synthesis of many aspects in natural communication.</p>
<p>All worlds are open and unbounded at the scale of the absolute microscopic, even while they must appear to be closed and bounded at the scale of the absolute macroscopic. All that enters into a world appears first at the microscopic limit<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-009'>[9]</a>. All creativity begins as a single event of interaction and co-incidence in the smallest scales, everywhere at once. All expression is an assembly of microscopic moments of intention.</p>
<p>The freedom of self to realize potential is directly related to the internal coherency, consistency, and continuity of that self. Where self is internally divided, there is much less freedom of choice.</p>
<p>The strength of a potentiality, or creative manifestation, is realized in the organization and coherency of many microscopic eventualities. The strength (energy) of a choice is proportional to the number of sub-choices in alignment necessary to bring about the actuality of consequence. Each alignment is itself a choice; a choice within a choice.</p>
<p>Change is not additive. Large, unbounded collections of 'insignificant small changes' can create overall effects far out of proportion to the apparent causes<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-010'>[10]</a>. The degree to which emergent, novel, and creative aspects are apparent is proportional to the degree to which there is a difference in scale between the mesoscopic<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-011'>[11]</a> scale (known) and microscopic (unknown).</p>
<p>Creation and creativity inherently involve the microscopic and the momentary potentiality. Small, incremental changes occurring everywhere at once are more conducive to creative expression than suddenly-realized 'grand sweeping events'.</p>
<p>The realization of choices at more encompassing levels of being is in the degree of the <em>coordination</em> of the choices which are distributed across the many selves of the encompassed levels of being<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-012'>[12]</a>.</p>
<p>The degree of individual freedom in a society increases dramatically in proportion to the degree of cooperation among individuals. A society or culture is strong to the degree that <em>everyone</em> is allowed to live creatively and live together.</p>
<p>A maximum of both acceptance and expression, unity and diversity, is necessary for a nation (society, tradition, religion, culture) to be strong. Diversity must be accepted and unity must be expressed. To have an expression of unity there must be an acceptance of diversity. To have an acceptance of diversity there must be an expression of unity. The strength of a nation is known as much through its flexibility and tolerance as through its commitments and follow-through.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=9>
<li id='footnote-009'><p>For example, the entrance of any new life (self) into a world always occurs through a single choice in multiple places (in the coincidence of at least two people). All birth begins at the smallest scale of existence.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-010'><p>This remains true, even though any small or bounded collection of microscopic eventualities will necessarily appear to have very little potentiality.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-011'><p><b>Mesoscopic</b>: middle scales; those ordinary ranges of size comparable to a human being.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-012'><p>For example, the realization of the choice to go to college is realized in a coordination (organization) of many smaller day-to-day choices to go to class, do one's homework, study, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Aphorisms of Love</h2>
<h3>The Nature of Love</h3>
<p>Love is an experience, an expression, and an understanding. It is the potentiality (essential quality) of all being. Where love is an experience it is a recognition, a knowing, and a realization of one's innermost feelings, dreams and desires. Love is potentiality, that pool of energy from which all desire, dreaming, and action is drawn. Where love is an expression it is the basis and the foundation of all emotion and desire (feeling).</p>
<p>Where love is an understanding, <em><u><strong>love</strong> is that which enables choice</u></em>. The quintessential meaning of Love refers to the quality of enabling and nurturing choice, joy, connectedness, and freedom. Love, in that it enables all life, significance, and choice, does not define or precondition being.</p>
<p>Love IS, and cannot not be. Love is unbound and formless. Love cannot be constrained, modified or conditioned by anything which exists. Love is always free, infinite, and giving of freedom.</p>
<p>Nothing which is in existence can prevent love from being loving. Nothing which has the nature of actuality can prevent the action of that which has the nature of potentiality, of creation.</p>
<p>As an energy, love is an emotion rather than a feeling. Energy, as a potentiality, is movement, and is, therefore, to be considered in terms of its intensity and direction rather than in terms of its quality<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-013'>[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Love is the most basic and fundamental emotion. Potentiality, desire, and energy are all intrinsic to all actuality, life, and being. Love is the energy and potentiality from which all other emotion, desire, want, and need, is drawn. All emotions have their root and ultimate basis in love.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the principle of love is unconditional (perfect). The dynamic of love (as "love of doing") is in no way dependent on any specific or particular form, detail, or quality. Love in being (as in "the being of love") is the principle of unconditional acceptance (also perfect).</p>
<p>Love has no opposite<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-014'>[14]</a>. Love is always the deepest and strongest emotion; stronger than fear, anger, or depression.</p>
<p>Love is always and forever given and received in a unique manner, with unique qualities. One cannot expect to receive love and nurturance in the same manner in which it is given.</p>
<p>Love has only the intention of giving. It is never about exchange or expectation. Love has no price; it cannot be bartered or exchanged for anything in the marketplace. Love can only arise as a natural dynamic of the potentiality, creativity, and evolution of being.</p>
<p>Love cannot be forced. It can never be conditioned or earned. Only respect can be earned and conditioned (to compel to be given).</p>
<p>Do something "good" that very few others can do and you <u>will</u> earn respect (an actuality to an actuality).<br />
Do not do something "bad" that nearly everyone one does, and you <em>might</em> be loved (a potentiality to a potentiality).</p>
<p>Respect is more meaningful when it is a reflection of one's actions (what one has done or is currently doing).<br />
Love is more meaningful when it is an acknowledgment of one's natural being (what one could potentially be).</p>
<p>One does not "have" love, one may only give it. No amount of the giving of love ever diminishes love or the potentiality of further love.</p>
<p>Love and choice are inherently unreasonable and illogical (non-causal). One can never be expected to give a reasonable or logical basis for one's values, desires, or creative decisions<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-015'>[15]</a>. Love is best understood and enacted in life in terms of significance, rather than structure, purpose, reason, or monetary value.</p>
<p>Divinity is best known by both love and gratitude. The action of <strong>Love</strong> is to give potentiality (to the world). The action of <strong>Gratitude</strong> is to receive potentiality (from the world).  One feels gratitude and allows a feeling of thankfulness when one accepts and has acceptance. The action of love and gratitude is the action of spirituality, of connecting oneself with the divine.</p>
<p>Love is an acceptance in giving, receiving, and feeling. The movement of love is a movement of self, a flow of potentiality from oneself to another self, a flow of feeling, thought, and perception.</p>
<p>To know love, one must participate in its unbounded flow.<br />
Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.</p>
<p>In that love is unconditional, acceptance is also unconditional. The effective realization of either unconditional love or unconditional acceptance necessarily implies the effective realization of the other.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term 'acceptance' is not the same as "to give up one's own choice". Acceptance and choice are distinct concepts. Choice is not acceptance. Acceptance is not choice. Acceptance is ultimately not a choice (eventually, everyone must accept at least something). Acceptance is about perception, the integration of perceptions into self. In contrast, choice is about expression. Both are necessary in one's own life.</p>

<li id='footnote-013'><p>The experience of "feeling love" (as a quality) is a reflection of one's desire and in this way is a recognition of potentiality. To consider the 'feeling of love' (rather than the potentiality of love) is to consider a <i>combination</i> of the energy of desire with a significant and personally meaningful quality. It is the added energy of desire and potentiality that encourages one to regard some feelings <u>as love</u> rather than as a feeling of something else.</p><p>The perfectly clear channel of unconditional acceptance (perfect love, which has no quality of feeling in itself) will be considered to have a subtle quality of feeling in direct proportion to the degree that some qualities, feelings, and experiences are regarded as easier to accept and integrate than others. It is in this way that the feeling of love is realized and known to the finite self as a feeling rather than as an unqualified perfection of potentiality. As one's spirituality expands and evolves, one's capacity to realize unconditional love also increases. Love is pure, and without particularity of feeling in proportion to the degree of one's spirituality.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-014'><p>It is a misconception to think that 'hate' is the opposite of love; hate is only a distorted expression of love. hate has the strong intention and expectation of changing someone or something external to self in a manner which is either unconscious or covertly manipulative. Hate is a characterization of anger, and is thus secretly driven by love. The absence of love is not hate, but apathy.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-015'><p>To the degree that one is able to give a 'reason' for their love, one is expressing a statement of <u>purpose</u>. Defining a relationship in terms of purpose is to describe a business transaction rather than an intimate and inherently meaningful connection. A statement of purpose is not a statement of value; it has no inherent significance. All life is lost when feeling, desire, and love are regarded as without value or significance.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Nature of Desire</h3>
<p>Love in its most abstract and <em>impersonal</em> sense is pure potentiality, pure energy without quality or form.<br />
Self in its most abstract and <em>personal</em> sense is pure quality without energy or form.</p>
<p>Desire is the combination and synthesis of the quality of self with the energy of love. Ultimate desire is the synthesis of the unlimited expansiveness of impersonal love and the infinitely detailed nature of one's innermost personal quality.</p>
<p>Desire is at once the basis for all choice, the potentiality to choose, and the selectivity of those choices.</p>
<p>Desires are interrelated. They do not occur in isolation and are interdependent with other desires.</p>
<p>Desires have various degrees of depth. Some desires are formed as an implementation of a deeper desire. The knowledge, resolution, and attainment of deeper desires will often decrease the intensity of many other surface desires.</p>
<p>Surface desires are often conflicted; one's deepest desires are never conflicted.</p>
<p>The meaning of a surface desire is clarified when its foundation in deeper desire is known. When surface desires appear to be in conflict, the knowledge and realization of one's deeper desires will always resolve that conflict.</p>
<p>When desires are confused (i.e., are internally conflicting or are unclear), or when one has conflicting ideas and beliefs, one has effectively become two smaller selves, each of which has significantly less freedom of choice.</p>
<p>One chooses most effectively when choosing as a unified self as a whole being, with attunement and at-one-ment with one's own innermost (deepest) desires.</p>
<h3>The Basal Motivations</h3>
<p><strong>The Basal Motivations of All Life:</strong> There are two ultimate desires inherent in all being:</p>
<ul>
<li>The desire to create and be creative (the expression of self-quality).</li>
<li>The desire to experience and have experiences (the perception of form).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most basic desire inherent in all consciousness is to maximize the degree (quantity), diversity (quality), and intensity of both the creative experience and the experience of creativity.</p>
<p>The ultimate purpose of evolution is to simultaneously maximize the degree of experience and creativity of all aspects of life, in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>The basal motivations are at the foundation of all desire and all cognition. Together they are the basis for and foundation of all love, life, growth, evolution, transformation, interaction, communication, learning, experimentation, being, and doing.</p>
<p>Creativity is expressive. It has its basis in potentiality.<br />
Experience is perceptive. It has its basis in actuality.<br />
Both actuality and potentiality need to be maximized for the full realization of life.<br />
Quality is as important as quantity. Potentiality is as important as actuality.</p>
<p>To maximize actuality (quantity) is to maximize experience and clear acceptance;<br />
the integrity of self, world, and symmetry in the relations between self and world.<br />
To maximize potentiality (quality) is to maximize nurturing choice and expression;<br />
the creativity of self, world, and continuity in the relations between self and world.</p>
<p>Creativity and experience are at a maximum when the greatest possible degree of the combination of static and dynamic aspects are realized. A maximum intensity of action occurs where elements of dynamic choice and creativity are intimately combined with elements of stable causality and experience.</p>
<p>All natural selection seeks to maximize both potentiality/creativity/evolution and actuality/experience/interaction. Optimal changes are ones which maximize the realization of future choices and the manifestation of past causality.</p>
<h3>Desire, Want, and Need</h3>
<p>Love has three aspects: Desire, want, and need.<br />
These aspects refer to the quality, form, and intensity of love respectively.<br />
Want, need, and desire are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.<br />
Each has its place, value, and validity.</p>
<p>The meaning of want, need, and desire are distinguished by where they arise and where they are realized. Considering the self as a conduit of connection between spirit and matter, soul and body:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desires</strong> are feelings that arise within the soul to affect the self.<br />
  They can only be realized from within the soul (an aspect of spirit).</li>
<li><strong>Needs</strong> arise within the self and can only be realized within the self (an aspect of mind).</li>
<li><strong>Wants</strong> come from the outer world and arise within the body to affect the self.<br />
  They can only be realized within or through the body (an aspect of world).</li>
</ul>
<p>Wants, needs, and desires are abstractions of thoughts, feelings, and emotions respectively.<br />
They are instructions<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-016'>[16]</a> of purpose, value, and meaning respectively.<br />
A life must realize all three, in proper balance, to be complete.</p>
<p>The realization of a feeling occurs in the same location and depth of self as that from which it arose.<br />
The satisfaction of a feeling is always a return to the origin of that feeling<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-017'>[17]</a>.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=16>
<li id='footnote-016'><p>'Ab-stract' as "out of form". 'In-struct' as "into form".</p></li>
<li id='footnote-017'><p>Feelings, thoughts, and emotions are not just aspects of that part of self known as 'mind' but as aspects of <i>all</i> of self. For example, feeling arise in the soul, the self, and the body.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Effective Choice</h3>
<p>An <strong>Effective choice</strong> is one that results in the realization and manifestation of desire<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-018'>[18]</a>.</p>
<p>The most effective choices are those which maximally support creativity and experience in the world, in the self, and in the dynamics between them.</p>
<p>An ultimately effective choice is one which realizes (manifests) the ultimate desires of all that is making that choice and all that is affected by that choice.</p>
<p>The ultimate innermost nature of self/soul is good. Ineffective actions and choices result from a lack of clarity between the soul and the mind. To have a lack of clarity is to have a lack of knowing and of understanding; it is an absence of wisdom.</p>
<p>To improve one's knowing and understanding is to increase clarity within the self, the effectiveness of one's choices, and the degree to which one experiences joy/happiness. Those who choose ineffectively can be nurtured and healed by enabling them to increase their degree of knowledge and understanding (i.e., teaching by example).</p>
<p>The most effective choices provide or result in the greatest degree of wholeness and integrity of both self and world (necessary for experience), while at the same time allowing for the greatest freedom to make additional future choices for oneself and others (necessary for creativity).</p>
<p>The degree of effectiveness of one's choices is proportional to the product of the degree to which one's choices and their results, coherently maintain, sustain, enhance, and nurture:</p>
<ol>
<li>the integrity and wholeness (the actuality and actualization) of the world, the self, and the relation between world and self.</li>
<li>the potentiality/realization/evolution of creativity and experience in all of life, including one's own life (the degree to which it potentiates other choices).</li>
</ol>
<p>Perception is effective to the degree that it is dispassionate, without judgment, precondition, or expectation.</p>
<p>Expression is effective to the degree that it is passionate — a reflection of one's dreams and inspiration — and is a clear manifestation of one's highest hopes and aspirations.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=18>
<li id='footnote-018'><p>Note: Effectiveness is defined in terms of desire rather than in terms of either want or need.</p></li>

<h2>Aphorisms of Mind</h2>
<h2>Aphorisms of Health</h2>
<h3>Joy and Pain</h3>
<p>[…]</p>
<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>All healing involves touch and connection. Healing is contact. One heals through touching; whether it be touching with the hands, with a scalpel, or with the soul. When there is contact — touching — healing will happen.</p>
<p>All forms of healing are ultimately forms of re-connecting. To heal is to make hale, to make whole, to connect all parts of oneself into one integral being. Joy and health in life nurtures, accepts, loves, and integrates all parts of self and life well and fully. This is the nature of spirituality.</p>
<p>Healing is a growth. Growth and healing happen <em>between</em>. Like growth, healing does not have a source or an origin, personal or impersonal. Continuity underlies all dynamics and processes of growth.</p>
<p>Mind negates absence, separation, and discontinuity. Where there is conflict, disconnection, or discontinuity in the fabric of one's perceptual matrix (the collection of all beliefs), there will be emotion and pain, drawing attention and awareness to the disconnection.</p>
<p>Individually and culturally, one should always move attention and awareness into those areas which have pain and need to be healed. Acute situations are the result of persistently ignoring a chronic problem.</p>
<p>The correction for obsession is not suppression, but extension. To focus on only one person or only one aspect of life — and to include nothing else — is a painful discontinuity: attention is uneven and in some places, absent. The lack of attention itself results in increased potentiality for painful surprises and experiences ("Everything is sudden to those who are blind").</p>
<p>Healing involves a letting go of form and a return to feeling. Connection and integration will always create new potentials and choices.</p>
<p>Manifestation is the movement of feeling into form. Attaching to a specific form of manifestation is to realize disappointment. In creation and manifestation, the resulting realized form will always be different than expected. Creation is cooperative and always involves more than self.</p>
<p>To remain attached to only one specific form and to discard or reject all others is to suffer an obsession, and in this way, discontinuity and pain; the distribution of acceptance and awareness is not equi-tempered<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-019'>[19]</a>. To let go of attachment to outer form allows for an acceptance of inner feeling (inner attachment). When the channels of feeling are opened, love can flow outward again and manifest as new and different forms.</p>
<p>The peak strength of the feelings and emotions aroused will be in proportion to both the acuteness of the conflict of one's commonly held ideas and beliefs and the degree of contextual importance with which those beliefs are involved in one's life.</p>
<p>The pattern, severity, and distribution of stress in the mind of self will define the pattern, severity, and distribution of conflict in one's life.</p>
<p>Difficulty in healing (the level of emotional intensity required) increases in proportion to the pervasiveness and fixedness of the involved ideologies, beliefs, ideas, and perceptions. The required subjective intensity, (and inversely, the probably of success of a healing) is proportional to the inertia associated with the structures of the mind needing to be changed. The greater the intensity (emotional force) and the lower the degree of fixation in the patterns of one's thoughts, the more effective the healing.</p>
<p>The more one's ideologies and beliefs are perceived 'Truths', the greater the degree of change in the state of consciousness — a change in the position of awareness — required to know them for certain as Actual Truths or to realize them as Beliefs deeply held.</p>
<p>The more that the perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies that one wants to change provide a common context for all of one's experiences in life, the greater the degree of abstractness, pervasiveness, and comprehensiveness of the efforts required to change them.</p>
<p>Where a blockage of emotion or a conflict of belief persists at a particular level of emotional intensity, the release of that blockage will require and involve a similar level of emotional intensity<a class='footnote' href='#footnote-020'>[20]</a>.</p>
<p>The flexibility of mind increases, often suddenly, with increasing degrees of emotional intensity. All perceptions, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies, are changeable when there is sufficient intensity.</p>
<p>Healings which are infrequent, singular, and which are directed to ultimate causes are more effective than multiple efforts toward multiple symptoms. As with all growth, sufficient time and peacefulness must occur between significant changes to allow for real integration. Healings which are too frequent, or which attempt to change more than one basic condition at a time, can easily lead to complex interactions and unexpected side effects.</p>
<ol class='footnotes' start=19>
<li id='footnote-019'><p>For example, a depressed person must let go of the expected form of realization of their love in order to return to the essence and deep inner nature of that love.</p></li>
<li id='footnote-020'><p>For example, the intensity necessary within the process of healing a traumatic experience will often need to be of a similar magnitude as that of the traumatic event itself. The difference between effective healing and an event of further pain is the context of safety, sacredness, knowledge, and awareness. In these cases, healing involves a special environment designed to handle that intensity; a context as much as a content.</p></li>
